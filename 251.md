# If the borrower's repayment time is close to the end of the loan duration and there is blockchain network congestion, the repayment may be delayed, leading to loan default.

### Summary

In the `payDept` function, it is required that the repayment time should not be later than the end of the loan duration (i.e. `nextDeadline`). There is no grace period for repayment. If the time when the borrower calls the `payDebt` function is close to `nextDeadline`, the repayment may be delayed due to blockchain network congestion, leading to loan default.
```solidity
        require(
195:        nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp,
            "Deadline passed to pay Debt"
        );
```
