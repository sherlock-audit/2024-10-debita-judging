# users will lose funds when cancelling offer

### Summary

when borrowers call cancel offer
the function checks if available amount is more than 0 before transferring the amount back to the user however due a vulnerability the borrower wont receive the available amount

    function cancelOffer() public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        BorrowInfo memory m_borrowInformation = getBorrowInfo();
        uint availableAmount = m_borrowInformation.availableAmount;
        require(availableAmount > 0, "No available amount");
        // set available amount to 0
        // set isActive to false
        borrowInformation.availableAmount = 0;
        isActive = false;

the function first check if the available amount is more than 0 then it resets the borrowInformation.availableAmount  to 0

now before transferring the tokens to the borrower the function again checks if the availableamount is more than 0

        if (m_borrowInformation.isNFT) {
            if (m_borrowInformation.availableAmount > 0) {
                IERC721(m_borrowInformation.collateral).transferFrom(
                    address(this),
                    msg.sender,
                    m_borrowInformation.receiptID

but due to the reset before this check the available amount will always be 0 and the transfer wont proceed
