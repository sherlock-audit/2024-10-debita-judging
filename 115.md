# Incentivized token may be locked in the DebitaIncentive contract

### Summary

Users can incentivize pairs for one specific future epochs. If nobody update funds for this pair in this epoch, the incentivize tokens will be locked.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaIncentives:225](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L225), users can bribe one pair via function `incentivizePair`. Users will transfer some reward token for one pair in one future epoch.
The problem is that if the principle is not attractive, and nobody lends this principle this epoch, this will cause the rewards tokens will be locked in the contract.
What's more, there is not any function to transfer these locked rewards tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Users incentivize one principle in one epoch A.
2. Nobody lends this principle in epoch A.

### External pre-conditions
