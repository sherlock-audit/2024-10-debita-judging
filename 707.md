# Lack of Proper Adherence to Upgradability Standards in DebitaProxyContract

### Summary

The `DebitaProxyContract.sol`, which serves as the proxy contract for the `LendOrder`, `DebitaV3Loan`, `BorrowOrder`, and `BuyOrder` implementation contracts, lacks a function to execute upgrades. Although the contract architecture implies support for upgrades, the absence of an upgrade function creates potential issues regarding functionality, security, and overall design clarity.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that in ```DebitaProxyContract.sol```, used throughout the protocol as the proxy contract for implementation contracts such as `buyOrder`, `borrowOrder`, and `lendOrder` contracts, as well as for loans created by the `aggregatorContract`, lacks the functionality to upgrade the contracts. It is unclear whether the protocol follows any standard upgradability patterns, such as UUPS, TransparentProxy, or Beacon, as none of these patterns appear to be implemented. Consequently, key upgradability functionalities are missing, and the implementation contracts themselves also lack upgrade capabilities.

In a prperly implemented upgradable pattern such as UUPS or Transparent Proxy etc.
The function below is used to upgrade the current implementation address to a new one:

```solidity

function upgradeTo(address newImplementation) external onlyOwner {
    _setImplementation(newImplementation);
}
```
However, since no upgradable pattern that includes this function is implemented, the implementation address cannot be changed, as the required upgrade functionality is not available.

### Impact

The lack of upgrade paths would necessitate a complete redeployment, causing the protocol to temporarily halt critical functions like borrowing, lending, or liquidations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The use of any of the known upgradable patterns (UUPS, Beacon, etc) that suits the design of the protocol
