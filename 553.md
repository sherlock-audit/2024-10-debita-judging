### Attack Path

The formula for calculating the floor amount of the auction is as follows:

```solidity
floorAmount = FloorPricePercentage * receiptInfo.lockedAmount
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L139

```solidity
File: AuctionFactory.sol
139:     function getLiquidationFloorPrice(
140:         uint initAmount
141:     ) public view returns (uint) {
142:         return (initAmount * FloorPricePercentage) / 10000;
143:     }
```

The valid range of `FloorPricePercentage` is from 5% to 30%, as per [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L192). Assume that it is set to 30% at this point.

The collateral to be auctioned, which is a veAERO NFT, has a locked amount of 10000 AERO. In this case, the floor price is set to 3000 AERO.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L470

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Loan.sol
417:     function createAuctionForCollateral(
..SNIP..
461:         uint floorAmount = auctionFactory.getLiquidationFloorPrice(
462:             receiptInfo.lockedAmount
463:         );
..SNIP..
470:         address liveAuction = auctionFactory.createAuction(
471:             m_loan.NftID,
472:             m_loan.collateral,
473:             receiptInfo.underlying,
474:             receiptInfo.lockedAmount,
475:             floorAmount,
476:             864000
477:         );
```

When the user defaults, the auction will be created to sell the veAERO NFT, with a floor price of 3000 AERO.

However, given the current market condition, the value of veAERO is unfavorable. No one is willing to purchase the veAERO NFT at the price of 3000 AERO. Thus, the market and its users are only willing to pay a maximum of 2500 AERO.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Note that even though the veAERO NFT has 10000 AERO locked amount, it does not mean that it is worth 10000 AERO. This means that buyers cannot simply perform an arbitrage by buying the veNFT for 9000 AERO, and immediately gain 1000 AERO in return.
>
> This is because the 10000 AERO within the veAERO NFT is usually locked up for four (4) years, and can only be retrieved after four years. The price of AERO four years from now will deviate from the present. Thus, the main value of holding the veAERO NFT is to claim the AERO incentive tokens and trading fee from Aerodrome. Thus, the price of veAERO NFT will mainly be determined by the number of AERO incentives and trading fee that can be claimed over the entire holding period.

Thus, the veAERO NFT being auctioned at the existing floor price of 3000 AERO will not be sold under this market condition.

As a result, the veAERO NFT will be stuck in the newly deployed auction contract with no way to update the floor price to a lower price, such as 2300 AERO, and restart the auction. There is also no way to cancel the auction and retrieve the veAERO NFT.

Only the auction owner can update the floor price OR cancel the auction and retrieve the NFT within it. However, these actions can only be performed by the owner, who in this case is the `DebitaV3Loan` contract. 

However, the issue is that within the `DebitaV3Loan` contract, there is no feature that will trigger the [`Auction.editFloorPrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L192) or [`Auction.cancelAuction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L168) functions.

### Impact

High. veAERO NFT is stuck in the auction contract and lenders will not be repaid.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Provide the ability for the lenders or admin to update the floor price and restart the auction.
