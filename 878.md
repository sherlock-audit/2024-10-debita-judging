# Risk of denial of service when claiming incentives

### Summary

In DebitaIncentive.sol, the users loop through claimIncentives() to claim their incentives allocated to them based on their activities within a given epoch, because this loop is unbounded and the number of users can grow, the amount of gas consumed is also unbounded.

### Root Cause

In DebitaIncentives.sol, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L142-L214, the choice to use an unbounded loop to claim incentive is a mistake as it would cause DOS when called by a large number of users.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Debita V3 team adds a new feature that improve lending and borrowing on their protocol
2. Because of the improvement the number of user borrowing and lending grows dramatically
3. Due to this large number of users wanting to claim their incentives, the claimIncentives() function cannot execute because it has reached block gas limit
4. As a result, users are unable to claim incentives. The users will be DOSed until the next epoch.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Debita V3 team adds a new feature that improve lending and borrowing on their protocol
2. Because of the improvement the number of user borrowing and lending grows dramatically
3. Due to this large number of users wanting to claim their incentives, the claimIncentives() function cannot execute because it has reached block gas limit
4. As a result, users are unable to claim incentives. The users will be DOSed until the next epoch.

### Impact

The inability of claiming incentives would lead to piling of user with unclaimed incentives.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The execution cost of claimIncentives() function should be examined to determine safe bounds of loops and the function for claiming incentives should be splitted into multiple calls.
