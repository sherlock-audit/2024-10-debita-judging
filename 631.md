# TaxTokensReceipts Contract Fails to Support Fee-on-Transfer Tokens

### Summary

The ``TaxTokensReceipts`` contract is intended to enable users to deposit fee-on-transfer (FOT) tokens and mint an NFT representing the deposited amount. This approach allows users to interact with other contracts (e.g., creating lending or borrowing offers) without affecting the internal accounting of the protocol due to the FOT mechanism. However, a logic flaw in the deposit function prevents the contract from accepting FOT tokens, creating a Denial-of-Service (DoS) scenario for users interacting with such tokens.



### Root Cause

The ``require(difference >= amount)`` check in the deposit function does not account for the fee deducted during the token transfer. For FOT tokens, difference is always less than amount, resulting in the check consistently failing.



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**: Users attempting to deposit FOT tokens will always fail this check and cannot mint the NFT required to interact with other contracts.
- **Loss of Intended Functionality**: The primary purpose of the ``TaxTokensReceipts`` contract—handling FOT tokens—is rendered ineffective.

```solidity
  // expect that owners of the token will excempt from tax this contract
    function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
   @>     require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
        return tokenID;
    }
```

### Mitigation

The validation logic should be adjusted to support FOT tokens
