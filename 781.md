# Incorrect transfer target address in buyOrder::sellNFT will lead to nft locked in buyOrder contract forever.

### Summary

The transferFrom method in buyOrder::sellNFT  sets wrong destination address, instead of transfer nft to the order owner, the nft will be transferred to the buyOrder contract itself, which will lock the nft in this contract forever.

### Root Cause

BuyOrder contract is created when a user want to buy NFT receipt. A NFT receipt owner can call BuyOrder::sellNFT method to sell his NTF in return to get the buyToken stored in contract. When selling NFT, the NFT should be transferred to the buyOrder owner, instead, the NFT is sent to the buyOrder contract itself, where the contract has no method to withdraw the nft receipt. Thus the NFT receipt will be locked into contract forever.

```diff
function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
        require(buyInformation.isActive, "Buy order is not active");
        require(
            buyInformation.availableAmount > 0,
            "Buy order is not available"
        );

-        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
-            msg.sender,
-            address(this),
-            receiptID
-        );
+        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
+            msg.sender,
+            buyInformation.owner,
+            receiptID
+        );
   ...
}
