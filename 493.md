# Deleting the Last Buy Order Causes Index Mapping Errors

### Summary

Deleting the last buy order causes index misalignment and stale mappings, leading to data inconsistencies.  

A lack of conditional handling when deleting the last buy order in `allActiveBuyOrders` will cause an array misalignment and incorrect index mapping for both `BuyOrderIndex` and `allActiveBuyOrders`, as the function `_deleteBuyOrder` inadvertently overwrites entries and creates stale mappings.

### Root Cause

In `buyOrderFactory.sol:_deleteBuyOrder`, the function does not handle cases where the buy order to be deleted is the last one in the `allActiveBuyOrders` array. This results in overwriting the last entry with itself, creating an unnecessary `address(0)` entry without effectively removing it.  

Example:
- In `buyOrderFactory.sol:140-150`, the `_deleteBuyOrder` function lacks a conditional check for cases where the index equals `activeOrdersCount - 1`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `activeOrdersCount` must be at least 1.  
2. The buy order to be deleted is the last one in the `allActiveBuyOrders` list (`index == activeOrdersCount - 1`).  


### External pre-conditions

None.  

### Attack Path

1. A buy order reaches its end and calls `_deleteBuyOrder`.  
2. The `_deleteBuyOrder` function attempts to delete a buy order at the last index of `allActiveBuyOrders`.  
3. The function inadvertently overwrites `allActiveBuyOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]` with `address(0)`, leaving a stale entry.  
4. The `BuyOrderIndex` mapping is updated incorrectly, creating potential misalignments in future order retrievals.  

### Impact

The protocol will have inconsistent data within the `allActiveBuyOrders` and `BuyOrderIndex` mappings, potentially leading to incorrect data reads, disrupted user experience, and possible failures in buy order-related functionalities. Future interactions with buy orders could be affected due to stale or erroneous mappings, causing potential financial or operational disruption.  


### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

To handle the deletion of the last buy order correctly, add a conditional check to handle cases where `index == activeOrdersCount - 1`. If it is the last buy order:  
- Set `BuyOrderIndex[_buyOrder]` to `0` without swapping or overwriting.  
- Directly decrement `activeOrdersCount` without modifying `allActiveBuyOrders`.
