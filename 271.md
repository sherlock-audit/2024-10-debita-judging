# Critical Precision Loss in Dutch Auction Price Mechanism

**Summary**
The `DutchAuction_veNFT` contract contains a severe precision loss vulnerability in its price decay calculation that could result in significant value loss for sellers, particularly in high-value NFT auctions

**Vulnerability Details**
The critical flaw exists in the constructor's [`tickPerBlock`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L93C1-L94C1) calculation:
```javascript
@>     tickPerBlock: (curedInitAmount - curedFloorAmount) / _duration;
```

This integer division drops decimal places, causing material price calculation errors.
Consider a real-world scenario with a valuable NFT:

Initial price: 1000 ETH (1000 * 1e18 = 1000000000000000000000)
Floor price: 100 ETH (100 * 1e18 = 100000000000000000000)
Duration: 7 days (604800 seconds)

Expected calculation:
```bash
Price should drop = (1000 - 100) ETH = 900 ETH over 7 days
Expected price drop per second = 900 ETH / 604800 seconds
                              = 0.001488095238095238 ETH/second
                              = 1488095238095238 wei/second

Expected tickPerBlock = 900 * 1e18 / 604800
                     = 1488095238095238000 wei/second
```

Actual contract calculation:
```bash
tickPerBlock = (1000 * 1e18 - 100 * 1e18) / 604800
             = 900 * 1e18 / 604800
             = 1488095238095237000 wei/second

Difference per second: 1000 wei
Total precision loss over 7 days: 604,800,000 wei (0.0006048 ETH)
```

**Impact**
Using current ETH value ($3,500):

1. Loss per auction: ~$2.12 worth of ETH
2. If the same auction contract is used for multiple high-value NFTs:
        - 100 auctions per month = $212 monthly loss
        - 1000 auctions per month = $2,120 monthly loss

3. Price decay becomes increasingly inaccurate:
        - First hour: 3600 * 1000 wei = 3,600,000 wei loss
        - First day: 86400 * 1000 wei = 86,400,000 wei loss
        - By week end: 604800 * 1000 wei = 604,800,000 wei loss

**Recommended Mitigation**
Implement fixed-point arithmetic using a higher precision scale factor:
```diff
+     uint constant PRECISION = 1e27;
        constructor(
                uint _veNFTID,
                address _veNFTAddress,

                bool _isLiquidation
            ) {
                // have tickPerBlock on 18 decimals
                // check decimals of sellingToken
                // if decimals are less than 18, cure the initAmount and floorAmount
                // save the difference in decimals for later use
                uint decimalsSellingToken = ERC20(sellingToken).decimals();
                uint difference = 18 - decimalsSellingToken;
                uint curedInitAmount = _initAmount * (10 ** difference);
                uint curedFloorAmount = _floorAmount * (10 ** difference);

              // High precision calculation
+              uint totalDrop = curedInitAmount - curedFloorAmount;
+              uint scaledDrop = (totalDrop * PRECISION) / _duration;

                    isActive: true,
                    initialBlock: block.timestamp,
                    isLiquidation: _isLiquidation,
