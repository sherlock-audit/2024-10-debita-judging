# USDT approval reverts blocking loan extension and debt repayment

### Summary

The protocol intends to support USDT, but uses the IERC20 interface in `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan()` and `DebitaV3Loan::payDebt()` functions to `approve` the lend offer when the lenders loan is perpetual. When approve is called with USDT as the principle token, the call will revert, block borrowers from extending their loan or paying their debt.

### Root Cause

The IERC20 interface expects a bool return value, but USDT doesn't return a bool which causes the revert.

Here's the problematic line in payDebt():

Here's the problematic line in extendLoan():

### Internal pre-conditions

USDT is the principle token.

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

1. Lender's loan is perpetual and is lending USDT as the principle
2. Matcher matches a borrower with the lender.
3. Borrower calls `payDebt()` to payback their loan or `extendLoan()` to extend the duration of their loan
4. Both calls revert due to the root cause mentioned above, blocking borrowers ability to repay debt or extend loan.

### Impact

Borrower cannot repay debt or extend their loan leading to loan default consequences.

### PoC
