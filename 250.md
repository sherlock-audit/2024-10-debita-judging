# Incorrect decimal handling causes failure with tokens having more than 18 decimals in Auction contract

### Summary

Auction.sol contract fails to handle ERC20 tokens with more than 18 decimals, leading to a contract revert during initialization.

For a previous issue in the same vein, refer to => https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/215

### Root Cause

The docs state that they will interact with `any ERC20 that follows exactly the standard (eg. 18/6 decimals)`. This does not mean that they will interact only with tokens that have either 18 or 6 decimals. For clarification, the term "e.g." is short for the Latin phrase exempli gratia, meaning "for example." It is used to introduce examples or illustrations. `So the aforementioned phrase should be interpreted as the protocol is expected to work with ANY ERC20 token that follows the standard, which mean they can have any number of decimals.`

Following this, in the constructor of Auction.sol contract, we have this line `  uint difference = 18 - decimalsSellingToken;` 

And this difference variable is used in:

```solidity
       s_CurrentAuction = dutchAuction_INFO({
            auctionAddress: address(this),
            nftAddress: _veNFTAddress,
            nftCollateralID: _veNFTID,
            sellingToken: sellingToken,
            owner: owner,
            initAmount: curedInitAmount,
            floorAmount: curedFloorAmount,
            duration: _duration,
            endBlock: block.timestamp + _duration,
            tickPerBlock: (curedInitAmount - curedFloorAmount) / _duration,
            isActive: true,
            initialBlock: block.timestamp,
            isLiquidation: _isLiquidation,
            differenceDecimals: difference
        });
```
Following this logic, if the sellingToken has more decimals than 18, the initialization will fail.

Auction::getCurrentPrice function also suffers from the same issue:

 ```solidity
    function getCurrentPrice() public view returns (uint) {
        dutchAuction_INFO memory m_currentAuction = s_CurrentAuction;
        uint floorPrice = m_currentAuction.floorAmount;
        // Calculate the time passed since the auction started/ initial second
        uint timePassed = block.timestamp - m_currentAuction.initialBlock;

        // Calculate the amount decreased with the time passed and the tickPerBlock
        uint decreasedAmount = m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock * timePassed;
        uint currentPrice = (decreasedAmount >
            (m_currentAuction.initAmount - floorPrice))
            ? floorPrice
            : m_currentAuction.initAmount - decreasedAmount;
        // Calculate the current price in case timePassed is false
        // Check if time has passed
        currentPrice =
            currentPrice /
            (10 ** m_currentAuction.differenceDecimals);
        return currentPrice;
    }
```
Considering 
```solidity
     currentPrice =
            currentPrice /
            (10 ** m_currentAuction.differenceDecimals);
        return currentPrice;
```
currentPrice would never return even if we could pass the initialization.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Contract becomes unusable with any ERC20 token that has more than 18 decimals
False assumption in decimal handling affects core auction price calculations
Restricts the contract's compatibility with valid ERC20 tokens

### PoC

It is assumed in the code that the maximum number of decimals for each token is 18

However uncommon, but it is possible to have tokens with more than 18 decimals, as an Example YAMv2 has 24 decimals.

Let's assume that we have a sellingToken with 30 decimals:
```solidity
  uint decimalsSellingToken = ERC20(sellingToken).decimals();
   uint difference = 18 - decimalsSellingToken;
```
 To demonstrate what will happen, we can use Foundry's chisel:

```solidity
Welcome to Chisel! Type `!help` to show available commands.
➜ uint difference = 18-30
Compiler errors:
Error (9574): Type int_const -12 is not implicitly convertible to expected type uint256. Cannot implicitly convert signed literal to unsigned type.
  --> ReplContract.sol:16:9:
   |
16 |         uint difference = 18-30;
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

➜ 
```

### Mitigation

Either add explicit validation like `require(decimalsSellingToken <= 18, "Token decimals must be <= 18");` or handle both cases properly.
