# The unsafe transfer of tokens using the `transferFrom` function

### Summary

We all know that using `transferFrom` to send tokens lacks the security of using `safeTransferFrom`.

### Root Cause

Vulnerable code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L269-L274
     We can see that using `transferFrom` to transfer tokens to a contract is somewhat unsafe. Additionally, the operation of checking whether the amount is zero after the transfer is a bit redundant.
     If it returns a bool value to determine whether the transfer was successful, then the vulnerability in the code is that it doesn't check whether transferFrom actually succeeded.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Using transferFrom to transfer tokens is less secure than safeTransferFrom.
- We cannot be sure if transferFrom successfully completed the transfer.
- Checking if the amount is zero after the transfer is performed in the wrong order.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Use the more secure safeTransferFrom for the token transfer.
- Change the order of the check for whether the amount is zero.
```solidity
              // transfer the tokens
             // IERC20(incentivizeToken).transferFrom(
           //     msg.sender,
          //    address(this),
         //     amount
        //  );
       //   require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
     
            require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                  IERC20(incentivizeToken),
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amount
            );
```
