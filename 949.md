# Variable Shadowing in the `owner` Variable

### Summary

The owner variable in the Aggregator and Factory smart contracts suffers from variable shadowing, which occurs when a local or function-scoped variable unintentionally overrides a state variable of the same name. This can lead to confusion in code logic and unintended behavior where the ownership of the contract can never be changed because the new changes will only update the local variable and not the state variable itself. All the contracts with `changeOwner` function are affected by this issue

### Root Cause

The owner variable is defined as a state variable in multiple smart contracts, including the `DebitaV3Aggreagtor`, `AuctionFactory`, `buyOrderFactory` contracts have the similar code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682

```solidity
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner;
}
```
In this code, the local parameter owner shadows the state variable owner. Instead of updating the contract’s state variable, the function inadvertently assigns the parameter to itself, effectively doing nothing.

1.	Pass newOwnerAddress as the owner parameter.
2.	Evaluate the require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner"); condition using the state variable owner.
3.	Reassign the local variable owner to itself (owner = owner), leaving the state variable owner untouched.

### Impact

When protocol owners attempt to use this function to transfer ownership and it fails, they may falsely believe the system is secure when, in reality, the code’s intent is simply broken.

### Mitigation

Rename Local Variables and Use distinct names for function parameters to avoid shadowing the state variable. For example:
```solidity
function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = newOwner;
}
```
