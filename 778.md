# Incorrect Break Condition in `getAllLoans` function  Causes Valid Loan to be Omitted.

### Summary

The `getAllLoans` function in `DebitaV3Aggregator` contract breaks too early due to an incorrect comparison operator, causing the last valid loan to be omitted from query results. 

```solidity
//loanID starts from 1 not zero. 
 if ((i + offset + 1) >= loanID) {
                break;
            }
```


### Root Cause

In contract DebitaV3Aggregator[getAllLoans](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L693) function,
- Since loanID starts from 1, `loanID` represents the last valid loan ID 

- loanID is incremented first in matchOffersV3, then used as valid index
- When i + offset + 1 = loanID, this points to a valid loan
- Breaking at >= skips the last valid loan

> Example scenario :
  loanID = 3 (means loans exist at indices 1,2,3)
  offset = 0
  limit = 3
  i=0: 0+0+1 = 1 < 3 (gets loan 1)
  i=1: 1+0+1 = 2 < 3 (gets loan 2)
  i=2: 2+0+1 = 3 >= 3 (breaks, misses loan 3)

>Should use `>` instead of `>=` in break condition. 

```solidity

function getAllLoans(
        uint offset,
        uint limit
    ) external view returns (DebitaV3Loan.LoanData[] memory) {
        // return LoanData
        uint _limit = loanID;
        if (limit > _limit) {
            limit = _limit;
        }

        DebitaV3Loan.LoanData[] memory loans = new DebitaV3Loan.LoanData[](
            limit - offset
        );

        for (uint i = 0; i < limit - offset; i++) {
   @-->         if ((i + offset + 1) >= loanID) { // @audit breaks when ==loanID, although loanId starts from 1. 
                break;
            }
            address loanAddress = getAddressById[i + offset + 1];

            DebitaV3Loan loan = DebitaV3Loan(loanAddress);
            loans[i] = loan.getLoanData();

            // loanIDs start at 1
        }
        return loans;
    }

```



 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Last valid loan is always missing from pagination results
- Incomplete loan data retrieval


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

change the if condition as following:

```solidity
        if ((i + offset + 1) > loanID) {  // Changed to > to include last loan


```
