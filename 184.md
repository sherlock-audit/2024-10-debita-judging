# Old owner of receipt NFTs will still be a manager in the corresponding vault contract allowing them to perform perform unwanted actions with veNFTs

### Summary

Users are set as a manager in the the corresponding veNFTVault contract when depositing their veNFTs. An issues arises when the user sells this NFT to a buyer through `buyOrder` because they are still set as a manager to its corresponding vault contract. 

### Root Cause

in [buyOrder.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92) a user fulfills the buy order of user and transfers their receipt. The problem is their is no transfer of the manager role so the old owner will still have owner permission in the corresponding vault contract for that receipt. Below is one of the examples of functions that the user would be able to call as they are still set as manager.
```Solidity
function claimBribesMultiple(
        address[] calldata vaults,
        address[] calldata _bribes,
        address[][] calldata _tokens
    ) external {
        for (uint i; i < vaults.length; i++) {
            require(
                msg.sender == veNFTVault(vaults[i]).managerAddress(),
                "not manager"
            );
            require(isVaultValid[vaults[i]], "not vault");
            veNFTVault(vaults[i]).claimBribes(msg.sender, _bribes, _tokens);
            emitInteracted(vaults[i]);
        }
    }
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Fulfills a buy order
2. Buyer is unaware of the need to call the `changeManager` function
3. Seller calls a function such as `claimBribesMultiple` to steal their rewards

### Impact

Several unexpected behaviors can be created for the buyer. They potentially can have rewards stolen/manipulated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Swap over the manager of the vault contract to the new owner of the NFT before fulfilling the buy order
