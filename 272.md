# [M-1] Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` function used in `DebitaChainlink::getThePrice` might return stale or incorrect results.

### Summary

The reliance on Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` function without adequate data validation may lead to stale or incorrect price data, which can cause inaccurate pricing for the Debita protocolâ€™s users as the system could mistakenly assume the price is fully up-to-date. This would potentially lead to inaccurate evaluations of collateral values.

### Root Cause

The core issue lies in the absence of validation checks for staleness and accuracy in the `latestRoundData()` function response used within [`DebitaChainlink::getThePrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L30-L47).

In particular, the `latestRoundData` function's returned `startedAt` and `updatedAt` fields and their values are not used and not checked in `DebitaChainlink::getThePrice` to ensure that the price data is the most recent:

```solidity
 function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
@>        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```

Without verifying these timestamps, the contract remains vulnerable to using outdated price data. In times of network latency, congestion, or Chainlink node issues, `latestRoundData()` can return stale prices, impacting calculations like LTV and collateralization ratios. Although the contest documentation states, "We will have a bot constantly monitoring the price of pairs. If there is a difference greater than 5%, the oracle will be paused until it stabilizes again," without these additional validation checks, the function may still rely on inaccurate price data. For example, with wBTC/USD pairs and current prices for wBTC, a 5% price discrepancy would result in a significant deviation, potentially leading to a significant mispricing of collateral assets.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `getThePrice` function is called by anyone via `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3`.

### External pre-conditions

Network latency or congestion can cause Chainlink price feeds to experience delays or downtime, resulting in `latestRoundData()` returning stale or outdated data.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Relying on stale or inaccurate Chainlink price data can result in multiple severe issues.
For example, if the collateral's value is overestimated due to some stale pricing, lenders may approve loans with insufficient collateral. Conversely, underestimating collateral value could block borrowers who actually have sufficient collateral to support the loan. 

Although the contest documentation states, "We will have a bot constantly monitoring the price of pairs. If there is a difference greater than 5%, the oracle will be paused until it stabilizes again," without these additional validation checks, the function may still rely on inaccurate price data. For example, with wBTC/USD pairs and current prices for wBTC, a 5% price discrepancy would result in a significant deviation, potentially leading to a significant mispricing of collateral assets. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The issue can be mitigated by adding checks in `DebitaChainlink::getThePrice` that will verify the correctness of the data:

```diff
    function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
-        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
+       (, int256 price, uint256 startedAt, uint256 updatedAt,) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();       

+       require(startedAt != 0,"Round not complete");
+       require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= MAX_DELAY, "Stale price");

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```
