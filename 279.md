# NFT Lock-In Vulnerability in BuyOrder Contract

### Summary

The sellNFT function in the BuyOrder contract results in NFTs being locked within the contract indefinitely. Once an NFT is transferred to the contract, there is no mechanism to transfer it out to the intended recipient, leaving the NFT inaccessible. The owner of the NFT becomes the BuyOrder contract itself, and no further retrieval or transfer is possible, even by the original owner or buyer.

### Root Cause

The contract lacks a function to transfer the NFT from the BuyOrder contract to its intended recipient (e.g., the buyer or a designated address).

Improper use of the IERC721.transferFrom method to transfer the NFT to the contract itself (address(this)) without subsequent logic to forward it to the buyer.

### Internal pre-conditions

The sellNFT function within the BuyOrder contract must be invoked.

The NFT is successfully transferred to the BuyOrder contract.

### External pre-conditions

The seller must initiate the sellNFT function and approve the BuyOrder contract to handle their NFT.

The buyer must have a valid buy order requiring the specific NFT.


### Attack Path

Seller calls the sellNFT function, transferring their NFT to the BuyOrder contract.

The contract retains the NFT with no function to transfer it out, making it inaccessible to anyone.

### Impact

1. Loss of Assets: NFTs transferred to the BuyOrder contract are permanently locked.
2. Denial of Service: The inability to retrieve locked NFTs disrupts the contract's intended functionality, affecting buyers.
3. Reputational Damage: The issue undermines trust in the contract, potentially discouraging users from interacting with it.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Implement Withdrawal Logic: Introduce a function to transfer the NFT from the BuyOrder contract to the intended recipient (i.e., owner).

2. Or transfer the NFT directly to the owner and not the BuyOrder contract
