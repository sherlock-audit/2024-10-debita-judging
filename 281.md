# A borrower can end up with his NFT collateral without paying off his loan + interes

### Summary

A borrower can end up his NFT collateral without paying off his `loan + interes`. This is possible due to absence of a check what address buys the NFT from [`Auction::buyNFT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L109-L161) function. This is a problem since the value of the Auction denominated in NFT underlying tokens will always be less than the `principle + interest` value meaning that there is no point for the borrower to pay his loan off to get his collateral back.

### Root Cause

Absence of check if the borrower of the loan is the address that buys off the collateral NFT

### Internal pre-conditions

The collateral of the loan should be NFT and the loan should have more than one lender, otherwise the lonely lender can just withdraw the NFT.

### External pre-conditions

 None

### Attack Path

1. Loan is created by matching various lend offers with 1 borrow offer.
2. Borrower doesn't pay his loan off and auction for the collateral NFT is created
3. Borrower waits until somebody wants to buy the NFT and frontruns him to get the lowest price possible (Can buy it off in the auction start as well)
4. Borrower gets his collateral NFT without paying `principle + interest` amount

### Impact

Borrower doesn't pay off his `loan + interest` amount and goes off with the collateral NFT, which on top of everything he bought on discount price, since the auction has started.

### PoC

_No response_
