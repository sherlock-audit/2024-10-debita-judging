# `DebitaV3Loan::claimCollateralAsLender` has a missing bool check that could trap lender's collateral forver

### Summary

The way `DebitaV3Loan` handles collateral claims has a bug. When the collateral of the borrower is an NFT the `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` function is called. When lenders try to get their collateral back, the contract doesn't properly check the returned bool. This means that the function will continue executing even if `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` returns false. They will lose their proof of ownership (NFT) while getting nothing in return - basically their collateral gets stuck forever.

### Root Cause

The vulnerable function:

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `_nextDeadline < block.timestamp && _nextDeadline != 0` - Loan is defaulted
2. `offer.collateralClaimed == false` - The lender has not claimed his collateral
3. `m_loan.isCollateralNFT == true` - The collateral of the borrow offer should be an NFT
4. `m_loan.auctionInitialized == fasle` - An auction is not initialized
5. `m_loan._acceptedOffers.length != 1` - Loan has more than one lender

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `_nextDeadline < block.timestamp && _nextDeadline != 0` - Loan is defaulted
2. `offer.collateralClaimed == false` - The lender has not claimed his collateral
3. `m_loan.isCollateralNFT == true` - The collateral of the borrow offer should be an NFT
4. `m_loan.auctionInitialized == fasle` - An auction is not initialized
5. `m_loan._acceptedOffers.length != 1` - Loan has more than one lender

### External pre-conditions

No External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A loan gets created with multiple lenders involved, where the borrower puts up a veNFT as collateral
2. Time passes and the borrower misses their payment deadline, putting the loan in default
3. A lender decides they want to get their part of the collateral, but no one has started an auction yet
4. This lender calls the [`claimCollateralAsLender`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L340) function, but their ownership NFT gets burned and `collateralClaimed` is switched to true in the [`claimCollateralAsNFTLender`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L377) function.

5. Now the lender is stuck - there's no way for them to get their collateral back even when the veNFT eventually gets sold

### Impact

The result from `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` function does not validate the return value from its internal call to [`claimCollateralAsLender`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L361) function which means that the `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` function will pass no matter if the NFT is calimed or not.

[`claimCollateralAsLender:Line-377`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L377) function sets `loanData._acceptedOffers[index].collateralClaimed` to `true` but actually the lender will not get his collateral back.


Once a lender tries to get their collateral under the conditions mentioned in internal pre-conditions, they're permanently locked out of getting their share, because the `collateralClaimed` will be equal to true. 

### PoC

No POC

### Mitigation

Just add this safety check:

```javascript
    bool success = claimCollateralAsNFTLender(index);
    require(success, "Claim not successful");
```
