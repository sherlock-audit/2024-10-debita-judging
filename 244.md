# Lender unable to claim collateral after auction due to premature flag update

### Summary

When `block.timestamp > nextDeadline()`, a lender calls `claimCollateralAsLender`, which sets `collateralClaimed = true` before an auction is created. If an auction is later initiated and completed, the lender cannot claim their share of the collateral because the `collateralClaimed` flag was prematurely set, leading to an inability to claim collateral after the auction.

### Root Cause

In `claimCollateralAsNFTLender`, when `m_loan.auctionInitialized` is `false` and `m_loan._acceptedOffers.length != 1`, the function sets `collateralClaimed = true` for the lender's offer and exits without reverting. This premature flag update prevents the lender from claiming collateral after an auction is created and completed.

```solidity
loanData._acceptedOffers[index].collateralClaimed = true;
```
This is premature flag update and it doesn't revert and returns `false`.

**Lender unable to claim**

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Auction Not Initialized:**  
   `m_loan.auctionInitialized == false` at the time the lender calls `claimCollateralAsLender`.

2. **Multiple Offers Exist:**  
   `m_loan._acceptedOffers.length > 1`, causing the logic in `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` to skip sending the collateral directly to the lender.

3. **CollateralClaimed Flag Set:**  
   `loanData._acceptedOffers[index].collateralClaimed = true` is executed prematurely in `claimCollateralAsNFTLender`.

4. **No Reversion or Alternative Path:**  
   The function returns `false` instead of reverting, allowing the state update (`collateralClaimed = true`) to persist even though no valid collateral transfer or auction resolution occurs. 

5. **Auction Created Post-Claim:**  
   Another lender or the borrower later calls `createAuctionForCollateral()`, initializing and resolving the auction, but the lender who called earlier cannot participate because the `collateralClaimed` flag is already set to `true`.

### External pre-conditions

1. **Deadline Passed:**  
   `block.timestamp > nextDeadline()`.

2. **Auction Not Yet Started:**  
   `m_loan.auctionInitialized == false`.

3. **Multiple Offers Exist:**  
   `m_loan._acceptedOffers.length > 1`.

4. **Lender Calls Claim Collateral:**  
   A lender calls `claimCollateralAsLender`, triggering `claimCollateralAsNFTLender`.  

5. **Collateral Claim Flag Updated Prematurely:**  
   `collateralClaimed` for the lender's offer is set to `true` before an auction is initiated.  

6. **Auction Created Later:**  
   Either a borrower or another lender calls `createAuctionForCollateral()` after the initial claim.

### Attack Path

1. **Deadline Passes:**  
   `block.timestamp > nextDeadline()`, and the loan becomes eligible for collateral claims or auction.

2. **Lender Calls `claimCollateralAsLender`:**  
   - The lender calls `claimCollateralAsLender`, which internally calls `claimCollateralAsNFTLender`.
   - At this point:
     - `m_loan.auctionInitialized == false`.
     - `m_loan._acceptedOffers.length > 1`.

3. **Premature `collateralClaimed` Update:**  
   - The function sets `loanData._acceptedOffers[index].collateralClaimed = true` without transferring collateral or reverting.
   - The function returns `false`, leaving the lender without collateral.

4. **Auction Initiated:**  
   - Another lender or the borrower calls `createAuctionForCollateral()`, starting the auction process (`m_loan.auctionInitialized = true`).

5. **Auction Completes:**  
   - The auction is resolved, and collateral or proceeds are distributed to eligible lenders.

6. **Affected Lender Cannot Claim:**  
   - The lender who called `claimCollateralAsLender` before the auction cannot claim their share because `collateralClaimed` was already set to `true` during the premature call.

7. **Lender Suffers Loss:**  
   - The lender is unable to retrieve their collateral or any auction proceeds, resulting in financial loss.

### Impact

Lenders who claim collateral before an auction is initiated lose their rights to collateral or auction proceeds due to a premature `collateralClaimed` flag update, resulting in financial loss, fairness concerns, and potential reputational damage to the platform.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Revert Premature Claims:**
   Update `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` to revert if `m_loan.auctionInitialized == false` and `m_loan._acceptedOffers.length > 1`:
   ```solidity
   require(m_loan.auctionInitialized, "Auction not initiated");
   ```
2. **Remove Premature `collateralClaimed` Updates:**
   Only set `collateralClaimed = true` after successfully transferring collateral or distributing auction proceeds.
