# changeOwner function fails to update the contract owner

### Summary

The `changeOwner` function in the contract fails to update the owner address, rendering the functionality non-operational. This occurs due to a logical error in the assignment statement within the function, where the parameter `owner` is incorrectly assigned to itself rather than updating the state variable.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/376fec45be95bd4bbc929fd37b485076b03ab8b0/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682-L686
- In DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682-L686, the line `owner = owner;` assigns the parameter `owner` to itself, rather than updating the contract's `owner` state variable. This mistake leads to no effective change in ownership.

similar issue in other two contracts also.

### Attack Path

### Impact

- The contract owner cannot be changed, which undermines the flexibility and intended functionality of the `changeOwner` feature.
- This could result in operational inefficiencies, as the inability to transfer ownership may block critical administrative actions.


### PoC

### Mitigation

To fix the issue, modify the function to ensure the state variable owner is updated correctly. Replace:

```diff
- owner = owner;
+ this.owner = owner;  
```
