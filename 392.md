# Debt is repaid without checking if the position is healthy

### Summary
Lenders are forced to incur loss even when a position has become insolven

_No response_

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L186-L197

Borrow positions cannot be liquidated before the loan deadline allowing lenders to suffer loss.
This is possible because
- the `payDebt()` does not check if the loan is still solvent when the borrower is paying their debt
- and loans cannot be liquidated before their deadline


```solidity
File: DebitaV3Loan.sol
186:     function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
187:         IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);
188: 
189:         require(
190:             ownershipContract.ownerOf(loanData.borrowerID) == msg.sender,
191:             "Not borrower"
192:         );
193:         // check next deadline
194:         require(
195:  @>         nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp,
196:             "Deadline passed to pay Debt"
197:         ); // @audit MED: does not chcek if the loan is healthy before repayment, hence loans that have become insolvent can still be repayed provided their next deadline has not been exceeded

```

### Internal pre-conditions

The only check implemented during repayment is that the loan has not exceeded its deadline

### External pre-conditions


### Attack Path



### Impact

Lenders will suffer loss due to their inability to liquidate a bad loan position before the loan deadline

### PoC

- Alice Borrow Order is matched against Bob's lend order 
    - Collateral = 1ETH ($4000), principle = 3000 USDT for a duration of 30 days
- the loan is currently collateralised at 75% tvl
- on the 28 day the value if ETH drops to $2000 making the loan under collateralized
- Either of two things can happen afterward
    - on the 29th day then Alice calls `payDebt()` to repay her debt and receive her collateral
    - OR she decides not to pay entirely leaving Bob at a loss if he decides to liquidate **after the deadline** (of which the collateral may have lost more value)

### Mitigation

Implement:
- a means to check for the health of the loan before repayment
- allow liquidation of insolvent loans even before their deadline
