# Flash Loan Exploit in `claimIncentives` Function of DebitaIncentives.sol

### Summary

The  `DebitaIncentives.sol::claimIncentives` is vulnerable to a `flash loan exploit`An attacker can manipulate the calculation of rewards `(porcentageLent and porcentageBorrow)` by temporarily inflating their lentAmount and borrowAmount through a flash loan. This allows the attacker to claim a disproportionately large share of the rewards for an epoch. The vulnerability arises from the absence of key mitigations, such as historical snapshots of balances or lock-in periods, which could prevent transient manipulations of lending and borrowing amounts.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

A malicious actor can drain a significant portion of the protocol's reward pool, leading to losses for honest users.

### PoC

1. Preparation:
- Identify the lending and borrowing principles mechanisms that affect lentAmount and borrowAmount.
- Select a token and an epoch with substantial rewards allocated.
2. Execution:
- Use a flash loan to borrow a large amount of the token.
- Deposit this borrowed amount to inflate lentAmount.
- Simultaneously, borrow a large amount to inflate borrowAmount.
3. Exploit:
- Call the claimIncentives function, leveraging the inflated porcentageLent and porcentageBorrow to claim a disproportionately 
high share of the epoch's rewards.
4. Profit:
Repay the flash loan, leaving the attacker with the rewards minus the flash loan fee

### Mitigation

Require lending and borrowing positions to remain locked for a minimum duration within an epoch to be eligible for rewards.
