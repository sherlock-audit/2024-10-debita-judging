# Repeated Deletion of Index 0 in Lend Orders Enables Potential Exploitation and Disruption

### Summary

The attacker create the Lend Order  and cancelOffer several times.
He can implement cancelOffer.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L156
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207
```solidity
lendOrderIndex[_lendOrder] = 0;
```
LendOrderIndex[_LendOrder] is still remaining 0 and _lendOrder is already verified.
So the attacker implementing cancelOffer several times, the first Order,allActiveLendOrders[0] is deleted several times.


### Root Cause

The attacker creates createLendOrder.
He performs cancelOffer funcion several times.

### Internal pre-conditions

The attacker creates createLendOrder.
He performs cancelOffer funcion several times.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The attacker creates createLendOrder.
He performs cancelOffer funcion several times.


### Impact

The attacker can delete all lend offers.
And the attacker receives collaterals several times from users who located first place(index=0).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace ambiguous values like 0 in lendOrderIndex with a unique sentinel value (e.g., type(uint256).max) to clearly differentiate between valid entries and removed orders.
