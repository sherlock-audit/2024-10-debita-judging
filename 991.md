# `matchOffersV3()` will revert when matching high value principle with low value collateral

### Summary

Due to insufficient precision in `ratio` calculation it will be rounded down to 0 in certain conditions. 

### Root Cause

Insufficient precision in `ratio` calculation:

Leading to later revert here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L535-L541
Even if it's sufficient to not be 0 at that point, ratio for the lend order has to be >10e4 in case `0.01%` `porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder` or >1e2 for reasonable `1%` `porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder` , otherwise it'll be truncated to 0 here:

### Internal pre-conditions

- principle with high $ price is matched with collateral with very low $ price

### External pre-conditions

- wBTC is valued at $100,000
- collateral token - some valid ERC20 is valued at <$0,01 or a little higher causing the second issue

### Attack Path

--

### Impact

`matchOffersV3()` does not support all potential matches that are legit according to the README.

### PoC

principle price = 100000e8
collateral price = 0.0098e8
principle decimals = 18
collateral decimals = 6

```solidity
ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral =  0.0098e8 * 1e8 / 100000e8;  // equals 9.8
// assume LTV 10000
ratio = 9.8 * 1e6 / 1e8 // 0.098 => 0 
```
### Mitigation

Add more precision to ratio calculation to make sure all supported tokens can be matched without reverting.
