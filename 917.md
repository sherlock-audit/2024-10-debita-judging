# Owner Shadowing Vulnerability

### Summary

The `changeOwner` function in the` DebitaV3Aggregator.sol` contract contains a vulnerability caused by shadowing the state variable `owne`r with a function parameter of the same name. This results in the function modifying only the local variable `owner` instead of the state variable, leaving the actual ownership unchanged. Additionally, the function contains insufficient access control checks, as the logic allows anyone to call it after six hours of deployment due to the flawed ownership validation.

### Root Cause

The function parameter `owner` in [DebitaV3Aggregator:682-686](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682-L686) has the same name as the state variable owner, causing the local variable to be modified instead of the state variable.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Ownership of the contract cannot be securely transferred, resulting in one owner forever.



### PoC

```javascript
 function testExploitChangeOwner() public {
      address newOwner = makeAddr("newOwner");
      address deployer = address(this);
      assertEq(DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner(), deployer);

      vm.prank(deployer);
      vm.expectRevert("Only owner");
      DebitaV3AggregatorContract.changeOwner(newOwner);
  }
   ```

### Mitigation

 **Avoid Variable Shadowing**:
   - Use distinct names for function parameters and state variables to prevent shadowing. For example:
```javascript
function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
   require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
   require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
   owner = _owner;
}
```

- **Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s Ownable Contract**:
