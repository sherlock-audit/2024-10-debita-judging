# Insufficient checks for stale price in DebitaChianlink.sol

### Summary

The ``DebitaChianlink.sol`` contract is responsible to fetching the price for assets used within the protocol via the [getThePrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L30-L47) function: 
```solidity
    function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }

```
However as can be seen from the code snippet above, there are no checks as to whether the price is stale or not. This is problematic, because if a stale price is reported, and borrowers and lenders are using oracles in order to determine the ratio at which they want to borrow/lend tokens one side will be overpaying, when the orders are matched.  

### Root Cause

There are no price staleness checks in the [getThePrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L30-L47) function.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If borrowers and lenders are utilizing oracles and LTVs to determine the ratio at which they want to borrow/lend tokens, stale prices leads to either the borrower or lender overpaying, when the orders are matched. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check whether the price is stale or not, keep in mind that the heartbeat for each pair is different.
