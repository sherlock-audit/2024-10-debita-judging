### Attack Path

The `TaxTokensReceipts` NFT receipt exist to allow FOT to be used within the Debita ecosystem. If users have any tokens that charge a tax/fee on transfer, they must deposit them into the `TaxTokensReceipts` NFT receipt and use the NFT within the Debita ecosystem.

The new Debita protocol has a new feature called ["Buy Order" or "Limit Order"](https://debita-finance.gitbook.io/debita-v3/marketplace/limit-order) that allows users to create buy orders, providing a mechanism for injecting liquidity to purchase specific receipts at predetermined ratios. The receipts include the `TaxTokensReceipts` NFT receipt.

Assume that Bob creates a new Buy Order to purchase `TaxTokensReceipts` NFT receipt. Alice, the holder of `TaxTokensReceipts` NFT receipt, decided to sell it to Bob's Buy Order. Thus, she called the `buyOrder.sellNFT()` function, and Line 99 below will attempt to transfer Alice's `TaxTokensReceipts` NFT receipt to the Buy Order contract.

```solidity
File: buyOrder.sol
092:     function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
093:         require(buyInformation.isActive, "Buy order is not active");
094:         require(
095:             buyInformation.availableAmount > 0,
096:             "Buy order is not available"
097:         );
098: 
099:         IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
100:             msg.sender,
101:             address(this),
102:             receiptID
103:         );
```

However, the transfer will always revert because the transfer function has been overwritten, as shown below. The transfer function has been overwritten to only allow the transfer to proceed if the `to` or `from` involves the following three (3) contracts:

1. Borrow Order Contract
2. Lend Order Contract
3. Loan Contract

Since neither the Buy Order contract nor the seller (Alice) is the above three contracts, the transfer will always fail. Thus, there is no way for anyone to sell their `TaxTokensReceipts` NFT receipt to the buy order. Thus, this feature is effectively broken.

```solidity
File: TaxTokensReceipt.sol
093:     function transferFrom(
094:         address from,
095:         address to,
096:         uint256 tokenId
097:     ) public virtual override(ERC721, IERC721) {
098:         bool isReceiverAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
099:             .isBorrowOrderLegit(to) ||
100:             ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(to) ||
101:             IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(to);
102:         bool isSenderAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
103:             .isBorrowOrderLegit(from) ||
104:             ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(from) ||
105:             IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(from);
106:         // Debita not involved --> revert
107:         require(
108:             isReceiverAddressDebita || isSenderAddressDebita,
109:             "TaxTokensReceipts: Debita not involved"
110:         );
```

### Impact

Medium. Core protocol functionality (Buy Order/Limit Order) is broken.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Buy Order contract must be authorized to transfer `TaxTokensReceipt` NFT as it is also part of the Debita protocol.
