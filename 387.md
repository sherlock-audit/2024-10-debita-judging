# `tokenURI()` creates metadata with wrong `_type`

### Summary

In the `tokenURI` function `_type` string can make the NFT associated either with `"Borrower"` or `"Lender"`. It assumes that every even number for `tokenId` must be a `"Borrower"` type, while odd number a `"Lender"`. This is not the case when `matchOffersV3()` is called with more than one lend order and multiple lender ownership NFTs are minted in a row. 


### Root Cause

In `tokenURI` it is assumed that `"Borrower"` and `"Lender"` type tokens are sequentially one after another:

This might not be the case:

if this for loop contains more than one element - `lendOrders.length > 1`:

### Internal pre-conditions

- more than one `lendOrders` are passed to `matchOffersV3()` 


### External pre-conditions

--

### Attack Path

Will occur by itself.

### Impact

Incorrect token URI is created which might lead to wrong image/corrupted data being displayed off-chain containing essentially random `_type` forever.  

### PoC

--

### Mitigation

Consider modifying the `mint()` function to allow passing in `type` parameter and implementing a simple mapping for tracking `type` for given `tokenID`.
