# Lenders Unable to Claim Collateral Due to High Floor Price

### Summary

When a loan's collateral is a **veNFT** and the loan deadline has passed, an auction can be initiated through the `createAuctionForCollateral()` function in the `DebitaV3Loan` contract. This function **makes `DebitaV3Loan` the owner of the auction** by calling the `createAuction()` function in the `AuctionFactory` contract.

Each auction creates a unique instance of the `Auction.sol` contract. This contract includes **owner-only functions**, such as [`editFloorPrice()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L192), which allows adjusting the auction's floor price.

While these functions are useful for independent auctions, they become ineffective for auctions initiated by `DebitaV3Loan`, as the `DebitaV3Loan` contract does not implement mechanisms to call these functions.

The issue arises when the floor price (15%) is higher than what potential buyers are willing to pay, leaving the auction unresolved. Without a buyer, the **lenders are unable to claim their collateral** because it remains tied to the auction. The lack of functionality in `DebitaV3Loan` to adjust the floor price creates a deadlock.

#### Why can the floor price be too high for potential buyers?

The protocol only takes into account the amount locked in the veNFT and does not consider other important variables, such as the voting power depending on the time locked. For example, this can make an NFT more or less valuable, leading to situations where buyers are only willing to pay 10% of the value locked in the veNFT.

Additionally, the protocolâ€™s aerodrome may lose interest, and a 15% floor price for a veNFT locked for 4 years may be considered excessive. This could result in the veNFT not selling at any auction unless the floor price is lowered.

There are multiple scenarios where a 15% floor price based on the value locked in a veNFT can be too high.

### Root Cause

`DebitaV3Loan` contract don't have any implementation on `editFloorPrice()` function in `Auction.sol`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- The price of the underlying token associated with a veNFT drops.
- The protocol experiences a loss of social interest and popularity. 
*Note: both are kind of related*

### Attack Path

#### Price AERO: 1.3 USD

**veNFT details:**
- Amount locked: 100,000 AERO (130,000 USD)
- Time locked: 4 years

**Auction created:**
- Floor amount: 15,000 AERO (19,500 USD)
- Initial amount: 100,000 AERO
- Price: 100,000 AERO
- Duration: 10 days

As the price of AERO can decrease, and the protocol may lose social interest (with fewer people investing in it), the value of the collateral becomes a problem.

#### Price AERO: 0.5 USD

**Auction finished:**
- Price: 15,000 AERO (7,500 USD)
- Duration: 0 days

People are willing to buy it at 10,000 AERO (5,000 USD), but because the price floor can't be modified, the veNFT remains in auction for a long time, preventing lenders from claiming their collateral.

### Impact

Lenders can never claim the collateral assigned to them.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow modifications to the auction's floor price directly through the loan contract, making the collateral more marketable.
