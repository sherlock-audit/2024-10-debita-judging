# The DebitaFinance protocol claims to support FOT tokens, but it doesn't

### Summary

According to the Readme the DebiteFinance protocol supports FOT tokens via the ``TaxTokensReceipt.sol`` contract:
> Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in TaxTokensReceipt contract

However this is not the case, as we can see from the [deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L58-L75) function:
```solidity
    // expect that owners of the token will excempt from tax this contract
    function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
        return tokenID;
    }
```
The FOT tokens are expected not the charge any fee when they are being deposited into the ``TaxTokensReceipt.sol`` contract, however most already created tokens that are being used don't have such mechanisms. This means that the majority of FOT tokens can't be utilized within the DebiteFinance protocol, contrary to what the protocol team claims.  

### Root Cause

The [deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L58-L75) function, checks whether the amount that was specified to be transferred is greater than or equal to the increase in balance after the transfer is complete. This is not how the majority of FOT tokens work.
