# Missing NFT ID Validation After Withdrawal

### Summary

The [veNFTVault.sol ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Equalizer/veNFTEqualizer.sol#L56)contract interacted with other external contracts that is out of the audit scope, while missing some important checks that might cause unexpected behaviour.

### Root Cause

The [veNFTVault contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Equalizer/veNFTEqualizer.sol#L56) contains multiple functions that interact with an external voter contract using the attached_NFTID. However, when the NFT is withdrawn via the withdraw() function, the [attached_NFTID is deleted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Equalizer/veNFTEqualizer.sol#L95) (set to 0) but no validation is performed in subsequent calls that use this ID.

The affected functions are:

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Calling these functions with an invalid NFT ID (0) could lead to:

- Silent failures where the voter contract accepts the zero ID but doesn't perform the intended action
- Reverts if the voter contract has zero-check validations
- Unexpected behavior if the zero ID is actually valid in the voter contract
- Potential cross-function reentrancy vectors if the voter contract's behavior with ID 0 is exploitable

### PoC

- User deposits NFT ID 5 into the vault
- User withdraws the NFT, setting attached_NFTID to 0
- Factory calls vote() or any other voter-related function
- The function proceeds to call the voter contract with ID 0, which may cause unexpected behavior

### Mitigation

Add a validation check in all functions that use attached_NFTID:
```solidity
function vote(address[] calldata _poolVote, uint256[] calldata _weights) external onlyFactory {
    require(attached_NFTID != 0, "NFT not attached");
    voterContract voter = voterContract(getVoterContract_veNFT());
    voter.vote(attached_NFTID, _poolVote, _weights);
}
```
