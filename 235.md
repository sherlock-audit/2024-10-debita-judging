# New borrow orders are deployed as implementation contract instead of proxy

### Summary

Debita intends both borrow and lend orders to be deployed as proxies. 

However, when `DBOFactory::createBorrowOrder()` is called, it deploys a new implementation contract instead of a proxy:

### Root Cause

Borrow order is deployed as an implementation contract instead of proxy:

### Internal pre-conditions

n/a

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

`DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol` imports the proxy contract:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L8

And also initializes the implementation contract in the constructor:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L53

But creates new borrow orders with the implementation contract instead of the proxy:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L106

### Impact

The borrow offer implementation contract isn't upgradeable since state won't be stored in the proxy contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
+      DebitaProxyContract borrowOfferProxy = new DebitaProxyContract(implementationContract);
+      DBOImplementation  borrowOffer = DBOImplementation(address(borrowOfferProxy));
-       DBOImplementation borrowOffer = new DBOImplementation();

```
