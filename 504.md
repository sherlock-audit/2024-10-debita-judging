# DoS of `cancelAuction` and `editFloorPrice` functions in the `Auction` contract

### Summary

The `DebitaV3Loan.createAuctionForCollateral` function creates auctions, with the `DebitaV3Loan` contract as the owner.
In the `Auction` contract, only the owner is permitted to cancel an auction and edit the floor price. However, the `DebitaV3Loan` contract lacks the functionality to perform these actions.

### Root Cause

The `Auction.cancelAuction` and `editFloorPrice` functions have the `onlyOwner` modifier from [L168](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/tree/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L168) and L194.

```solidity
        modifier onlyOwner() {
            require(msg.sender == s_ownerOfAuction, "Only the owner");
            _;
        }
L168:   function cancelAuction() public onlyActiveAuction onlyOwner
        [...]
        function editFloorPrice(
            uint newFloorAmount
L194:   ) public onlyActiveAuction onlyOwner
```

And the `s_ownerOfAuction` is set in the constructor.

```solidity
    constructor(
        uint _veNFTID,
        address _veNFTAddress,
        address sellingToken,
        address owner,
        uint _initAmount,
        uint _floorAmount,
        uint _duration,
        bool _isLiquidation
    ) {
        s_ownerOfAuction = owner;
        factory = msg.sender;
    }
```

The `AuctionFactory.createAuction` function sets the owner of auction as `msg.sender` from L85.

```solidity
        DutchAuction_veNFT _createdAuction = new DutchAuction_veNFT(
            _veNFTID,
            _veNFTAddress,
            liquidationToken,
L85:        msg.sender,
            _initAmount,
            _floorAmount,
            _duration,
            IAggregator(aggregator).isSenderALoan(msg.sender) // if the sender is a loan --> isLiquidation = true
        );
```

And the `AuctionFactory.createAuction` function is called in the `DebitaV3Loan.createAuctionForCollateral` function from L470.

```solidity
L470:   address liveAuction = auctionFactory.createAuction(
            m_loan.NftID,
            m_loan.collateral,
            receiptInfo.underlying,
            receiptInfo.lockedAmount,
            floorAmount,
            864000
        );
```

Therefore, the owner of the auction is the `DebitaV3Loan` contract. This implies that only the `DebitaV3Loan` contract can call the `cancelAuction` and `editFloorPrice` functions. However, the `DebitaV3Loan` contract does not contain any code to invoke these functions. Consequently, the auction cannot be canceled, and the floor price cannot be edited.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The auction creators are unable to cancel the auction or edit the floor price.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Implement the functionality for canceling an auction and editing the floor price in the `DebitaV3Loan` contract.
