# DoS Vulnerability Allows NFT Collateral Orders to Fail Due to Improper Validation

### Summary

When creating a borrow order with NFT collateral (_isNFT == true), the contract attempts to check the balance of the collateral using the IERC20.balanceOf function. However, NFTs (ERC-721) do not track balances in this way, causing the validation to fail. This results in a Denial of Service (DoS) for borrowers attempting to create orders with NFT collateral, effectively blocking the creation of such orders.

### Root Cause



The root cause of the issue is the improper handling of collateral type differentiation in the order creation logic. Specifically:  

- The function assumes a uniform validation method (`IERC20.balanceOf`) for both ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens.  
- NFTs (ERC-721) do not use a `balanceOf` function to track ownership, resulting in incorrect validation when `_isNFT == true`.  
- This mismatch leads to a failure in the collateral validation step, preventing the creation of borrow orders with NFT collateral.

```solidity
uint balance = IERC20(_collateral).balanceOf(address(borrowOffer));
require(balance >= _collateralAmount, "Invalid balance");
``` 


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L89C9-L93C1

```solidity
if (_isNFT) {
            require(_receiptID != 0, "Receipt ID cannot be 0");
            require(_collateralAmount == 1, "Started Borrow Amount must be 1");
        }
```  

For NFT collateral, this check is invalid because:  
- `IERC20.balanceOf` does not apply to ERC-721 tokens.  
- NFTs are verified through ownership (`IERC721.ownerOf`), not balances.  

This oversight causes the logic to break for NFT-based borrow orders because the balance would be zero and collateralAmount 1.


### Impact

Borrowers attempting to create a borrow order with NFT collateral (`_isNFT == true`) will fail the collateral validation step due to the inappropriate use of `IERC20.balanceOf`.



### Mitigation


Update the collateral validation to differentiate between fungible (ERC-20) and non-fungible (ERC-721) tokens:  

```solidity
if (_isNFT) {
    require(
        IERC721(_collateral).ownerOf(_receiptID) == address(borrowOffer),
        "NFT not transferred"
    );
} else {
    uint balance = IERC20(_collateral).balanceOf(address(borrowOffer));
    require(balance >= _collateralAmount, "Invalid balance");
}
```
