# Fee-On-Transfer Tokens Reverts in TaxTokensReceipts::deposit()

### Summary

The `TaxTokensReceipts::deposit()` function uses the amount parameter both for transferring tokens and for accounting. However, fee-on-transfer tokens reduce the actual number of tokens received. This discrepancy breaks the accounting logic, causing the deposit() function to revert when fee-on-transfer tokens are used.

As stated in the README, fee-on-transfer tokens are expected to be used exclusively in the TaxTokensReceipts contract.

### Root Cause

The implementation does not account for the reduced token amount caused by transfer fees.
Relevant code:
[TaxTokensReceipts.sol#L69](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L69)

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

The system interacts with fee-on-transfer tokens that reduce the transferred amount.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The deposit() function fails and reverts when fee-on-transfer tokens are used, making it incompatible with such tokens
