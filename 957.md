# Insufficient Validation of sequencerUptimeFeed Status in Sequencer Check Logic

### Summary

The [chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) says that `sequencerUptimeFeed` can return a 0 value for `startedAt` if it is called during an "invalid round".

> * startedAt: This timestamp indicates when the sequencer changed status. This timestamp returns `0` if a round is invalid. When the sequencer comes back up after an outage, wait for the `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME` to pass before accepting answers from the data feed. Subtract `startedAt` from `block.timestamp` and revert the request if the result is less than the `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME`.

Please note that an "invalid round" is described to mean there was a problem updating the sequencer's status, possibly due to network issues or problems with data from oracles, and is shown by a `startedAt` time of 0 and `answer` is 0



### Root Cause

in the checkSequencer() in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L49-L68, lacks critical validation step to ensure that the startedAt value returned by the sequencerUptimeFeed is non-zero. The missing check overlooks the potential scenario where the sequencerUptimeFeed is queried during an invalid round

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Inadequate checks to confirm the correct status of the `sequencerUptimeFeed` in `DebitaChainlink.sol::checkSequencer()` contract will cause `checkSequencer()` to not revert even when the sequencer uptime feed is not updated or is called in an invalid round.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

update the checkSequencer function to 

```diff
    function checkSequencer() public view returns (bool) {
        (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, , ) = sequencerUptimeFeed
            .latestRoundData();

        // Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
        // Answer == 1: Sequencer is down
        bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
        if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert SequencerDown();
        }
        console.logUint(startedAt);
        // Make sure the grace period has passed after the
        // sequencer is back up.
        uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
        if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
            revert GracePeriodNotOver();
        }
        
+               if (startedAt == 0){
+                   revert();
+               }

        return true;
    }
```
