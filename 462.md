# Price from the Chainlink Oracle needs to be checked by using the returned values `updatedAt` and `answeredInRound`

### Summary

The price of the principle and collateral needs to be the latest price to ensure that the protocol does not compute the `ratio` with stale price. Hence, the values that are returned by the Chainlink Oracle namely `updatedAt` and `answeredInRound`, needs to be verified. 

### Root Cause

The [`DebitaChainlink::getThePrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L30) function calls [`priceFeed.latestRoundData()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L42) to get the most fresh price from the priceFeed. According to the Chainlink documentations, the function is defined as follows: 

```solidity
function latestRoundData(
    address base,
    address quote
  )
    external
    view
    override
    checkPairAccess()
    returns (
      uint80 roundId,
      int256 answer,
      uint256 startedAt,
      uint256 updatedAt,
      uint80 answeredInRound
    )
```

Out of all the returned values, the Debita protocol only uses the `answer` value. The function should check the `updatedAt`, and `answeredInRound` return values to ensure that the price is not too old.

### Impact

Without checking the correct prices of the principles and/or collaterals, wrong data will be fed into the protocol to calculate the wrong `ratio` and lastly provide bad debt to the borrowers and lenders.
