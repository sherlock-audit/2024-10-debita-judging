# We try to get the balance of a user with ERC20 interface, but the address may be ERC721

### Summary

In `createBorrowOrder()` we check the balance of a just created `borrowOffer` with the [IERC20 interface](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L143), but this will result in a revert, due to the possibility of having the `_collateral` as an ERC721 standard and not ERC20.

### Root Cause

The root cause is trying to fetch the balance of a particular borrow offer that has a collateral with the standard of `ERC721` via the `ERC20` interface will result in a revert, making it impossible to create a borrow offer with an ERC721 as collateral.

It should try to fetch the `ERC721` balance in the [if](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L125-L130) block and the `ERC20` balance in the [else](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L131-L138) block
