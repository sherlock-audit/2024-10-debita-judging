# Change Owner function doesnt check sequencer uptime feed

### Summary

Let's look at the [implementation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682) of the changeOwner function in `Aggregator`, `AuctionFactory`, `BuyOrderFactory`
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }

We can see that the owner can only be changed within the first 6 hours of the contract being deposited. However, on L2 networks on which the protocol will be deployed - for example Arbitrum sequencer can fail and not work for several hours (there were cases when sequencer did not work for 10 hours on Arbitrum).

Thus, if the sequencer fails within the first 6 hours, it will not be possible to change the owner if necessary.

### Root Cause

Change owner function relies on time, but does not take into account that the sequencer may fail

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. It becomes necessary to change the owner in the first 6 hours of deployment.

2. Sequencer fails and stops processing transactions. In the worst case scenario, it may crash for > 6 hours and then the functionality will not be available at all.

### Attack Path

No special attack path

### Impact

I think this issue deserves medium severity.

The protocol relies on a short period of time in L2 networks and does not take into account that the sequencer may go down. The probability is low, but the impact is high

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add check sequencer status. And if it crashes - give the option to change the owner to bypass the time when sequencer was not processing transactions.

Alternatively, make the refresh period longer - 6 hours is very short for L2 networks where the sequencer can fail for longer.
