# Unsafe usage of approve method.

### Summary

IERC20(token).approve revert if the underlying ERC20 token approve does not return boolean.

### Root Cause
Since it is stated in readme that.
>We will interact with :

>any ERC20 that follows exactly the standard (eg. 18/6 decimals)
Receipt tokens (All the interfaces from "contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/..")
USDC and USDT
Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in TaxTokensReceipt contract

So for non-standard token such as USDT,

calling approve will revert because the solmate ERC20 enforce the underlying token return a boolean.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Token in use must be a token like USDT which does not return a bool on approval.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

USDT or other ERC20 token that does not return boolean for approve is not supported for principal token.

```solidity
IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);
```

### Mitigation

Use `safeApprove` instead of `approve`
