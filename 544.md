### Attack Path

All Fee-on-Transfer (FOT) tokens have to be wrapped with the `TaxTokensReceipt` NFT to be used within the protocol.

Bob has 10,000 FOT. Thus, he deposits 10,000 FOT into the `TaxTokensReceipt` contract via the [`TaxTokensReceipts.deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L59) function, and a `TaxTokensReceipt` NFT representing 10,000 FOT will be minted for Bob.

Bob creates a new borrow offer and uses the newly minted `TaxTokensReceipt` NFT as collateral.

Bob's borrow offer is matched against a number of lending offers, and a new Loan contract is created. The `TaxTokensReceipt` NFT within Bob's borrow offer will be transferred to the newly created Loan contract to be held as collateral.

Bob defaults on the Loan. As a result, a new auction is created to auction off the  `TaxTokensReceipt` NFT held within the Loan contract to repay the lender. Line 93 below shows that the  `TaxTokensReceipt` NFT will be transferred into the newly created Auction contract.

```solidity
File: AuctionFactory.sol
68:     function createAuction(
..SNIP..
75:     ) public returns (address) {
76:         // check if aggregator is set
77:         require(aggregator != address(0), "Aggregator not set");
78: 
79:         // initAmount should be more than floorAmount
80:         require(_initAmount >= _floorAmount, "Invalid amount");
81:         DutchAuction_veNFT _createdAuction = new DutchAuction_veNFT(
..SNIP..
90:         );
91: 
92:         // Transfer veNFT
93:         IERC721(_veNFTAddress).safeTransferFrom(
94:             msg.sender,
95:             address(_createdAuction),
96:             _veNFTID,
97:             ""
98:         );
```

Buyer will call the `Auction.buyNFT` function to purchase the auctioned NFT. When the NFT is sold, Line 148 within the function will attempt to transfer the `TaxTokensReceipt` NFT held within the Auction contract to the buyer.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L148

```solidity
File: Auction.sol
109:     function buyNFT() public onlyActiveAuction {
..SNIP..
148:         IERC721 Token = IERC721(s_CurrentAuction.nftAddress);
149:         Token.safeTransferFrom(
150:             address(this),
151:             msg.sender,
152:             s_CurrentAuction.nftCollateralID
153:         );
```

However, the transfer will always revert because the transfer function has been overwritten, as shown below. The transfer function has been overwritten to only allow the transfer to proceed if the `to` or `from` involves the following three (3) contracts:

1. Borrow Order Contract
2. Lend Order Contract
3. Loan Contract

Since neither the Auction contract nor the buyer is the above three contracts, the transfer will always fail. Thus, there is no way for the collateral to be auctioned off, and the collateral will be stuck. As a result, lenders will not get repaid, leading to a loss of assets.

```solidity
File: TaxTokensReceipt.sol
093:     function transferFrom(
094:         address from,
095:         address to,
096:         uint256 tokenId
097:     ) public virtual override(ERC721, IERC721) {
098:         bool isReceiverAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
099:             .isBorrowOrderLegit(to) ||
100:             ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(to) ||
101:             IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(to);
102:         bool isSenderAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
103:             .isBorrowOrderLegit(from) ||
104:             ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(from) ||
105:             IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(from);
106:         // Debita not involved --> revert
107:         require(
108:             isReceiverAddressDebita || isSenderAddressDebita,
109:             "TaxTokensReceipts: Debita not involved"
110:         );
```

### Impact

High. Loss of assets as lenders cannot get repaid, and collateral is stuck.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Auction contract must be authorized to transfer `TaxTokensReceipt` NFT as it is also part of the Debita protocol.
