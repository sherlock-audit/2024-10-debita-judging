# `BuyOrder` is not compliant with `TaxTokenReceipt`

### Summary

When a user call the [`BuyOrder::sellNFT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92-L142) function, he will encounter the following block of code:
```javascript
        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            receiptID
        );
```
If the `buyInformation.wantedToken` address is a `TaxTokenReceipt` NFT, the transfer will always revert due to the checks performed in the  `TaxTokenReceipt::transferFrom` function:
```javascript
   function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public virtual override(ERC721, IERC721) {
        bool isReceiverAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(to) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(to) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(to);
        bool isSenderAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(from) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(from) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(from);
        // Debita not involved --> revert
        require(
            isReceiverAddressDebita || isSenderAddressDebita,
            "TaxTokensReceipts: Debita not involved"
        );
```
As seen here, if the `to` or `from` addresses are not `BorrowOrder`, `LendOrder` or a `Loan`, the transaction will revet. This is the case with calling the `sellNFT` function as well. Since the borrow offer doesn't have the possibility to call the `sellNFT` function, there is no way for the transaction to go through, making the whole `BuyOrderFactory => BuyOrder` functionality completely unusable with `TaxTokenReceipt` NFT.

### Root Cause

Absence of check if the `to` or `from` address are part of the `Debita` contracts

### Internal pre-conditions

`TaxTokenReceipt` NFT being wanted from the buyer

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The `BuyOrderFactory => BuyOrder` functionality is not compliant with `TaxTokenReceipt` NFT.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add a check in the `TaxTokenReceip::transferFrom` function to ensure that if the `to` or `from` addresses are part of the `Debita` system (Because they are and otherwise the transfer will always revert).
