# Attacker Can Grief Users and Cause Permanent Fund Loss Through Deterministic Contract Deployment Addresses

### Summary

The protocol allows users to borrow assets by deploying new borrower contracts `DBOImplementation` via the `DBOFactory::createBorrowOrder` function. While the protocol attempts to ensure that fee-on-transfer (FOT) tokens are not used directly, the deterministic nature of the deployed contract addresses enables malicious borrowers to bypass these protections. They can pre-fund the contract with FOT tokens and meet the balance requirements, despite the protocol's intention to disallow such tokens.
This exploit creates a mismatch between internal accounting and actual token balances, which can lock collateral in contracts. Lenders are unable to claim their collateral when borrowers default, leading to systemic failures in liquidation processes and potential financial loss for the protocol and its users.

### Root Cause

The use of the `CREATE` opcode to deploy the `DBOImplementation` (borrow offer) contracts makes their addresses predictable based on the current nonce of the deploying contract. This deterministic nature allows an attacker to precompute these addresses and potentially exploit this knowledge.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker must be aware of the nonce of the factory contract. (This can be easily gotten form block explorers)
2. The attacker can precompute the address of the implementation contract using the formula:
```solidity
address = keccak256(rlp(senderAddress, nonce))
```


### Attack Path
Note: In this attack, the malicious user is likely to specify a high LTV so they experience less loss, while the Lender will loose all the principal they provided.
Why carry out this exploit;
The attacker could be a competitor in the space rendering the same service as `Debita`, and wants to force bad user experience.

1. Attacker monitors the nonce of the `DBOFactory` contract (e.g., current nonce = 10).
3. The attacker calculates the address of the next borrow offer contract (nonce + 1):
```solidity
address predictedAddress = keccak256(rlp(DBOFactoryAddress, 11));
```
4. Before deploying the contract, they send FOT tokens directly to this address, ensuring enough balance after fees to pass the [protocolâ€™s validation checks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L143).
5. The malicious borrower sends an extra amount of the FOT token to the `DevitaV3Aggregator` contract where their offer will be matched, to cover for the fees that will be charged when sending out the tokens from their `DBOImplementation` contract, to the `DevitaV3Aggregator`, on matching the offers
6. This malicious borrow order is matched with a lendOrder, that accepts the token as a collateral.
**It is important to note that Lenders are free to accept FOT tokens as collateral, that is why the architecture supports them by swapping them for NFTs to avoid diminishing its value by too many transfers.**
7. On successfully matching the offer, The collateral is sent out to a newly deployed `DebitaV3Loan`. This transaction also charges fees and results in issues with the internal accounting of the contract
8. borrower defaults, and stays for an extended period without repayment
9. Lender will be unable to sieze collateral, because the `claimCollateralAsLender` function attempts to send back the exact collateral amount that was initially sent.

```solidity
    function claimCollateralAsLender(uint index) external nonReentrant {
        LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
        infoOfOffers memory offer = m_loan._acceptedOffers[index];
        IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);
        require(
            ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) == msg.sender,
            "Not lender"
        );
        // burn ownership
        ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID);
        uint _nextDeadline = nextDeadline();

        require(offer.paid == false, "Already paid");
        require(
            _nextDeadline < block.timestamp && _nextDeadline != 0,
            "Deadline not passed"
        );
        require(offer.collateralClaimed == false, "Already executed");

        // claim collateral
        if (m_loan.isCollateralNFT) {
            claimCollateralAsNFTLender(index);
        } else {
            loanData._acceptedOffers[index].collateralClaimed = true;
            uint decimals = ERC20(loanData.collateral).decimals();
            SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
                IERC20(loanData.collateral),
                msg.sender,
 @>>            (offer.principleAmount * (10 ** decimals)) / offer.ratio
            );
        }
        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));
    }
```


### Impact
Permanent Loss of Funds for the lender 
### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the `CREATE2` opcode with a random `salt` during deployment to prevent deterministic address calculation.
