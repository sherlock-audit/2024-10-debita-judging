# Prices from chainlink and pyth oracles are not validated

### Summary

Prices gotten from the pyth and chainlink oracles are not properly validated before consumed.

### Root Cause

- DebitalChainlink.sol : The Debita protocol uses this contract to fetch prices for assets from the chainlink protocol, the issue is that prices gotten from chainlink oracles using the `latestRoundData()` could be stale and should always be validated as recommended by the chainlink pricefeed documents
- DebitaPyth.sol : This module similar to the *DebitaChainlink* integrates with the pyth protocol to fetch prices of assets , also similarly to the DebitaChainlink   module the prices returned from the pyth oracle isn't validated.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Invalidation could lead to the use of incorrect/stale prices for critical financial state mutating operations.

### Attack Path

- 

### Impact

- Stale/Incorrect prices could lead to financial loss in the protocol.

### PoC

- None

### Mitigation

- Implement validation as proposed in the official documentation.
