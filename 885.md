### Root Cause

As we can see at the end of the sellNFT function the NFT is never transfered to the buyer.

```solidity 
        uint feeAmount = (amount *
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).sellFee()) / 10000;
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(buyInformation.buyToken),
            msg.sender,
            amount - feeAmount
        );

        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(buyInformation.buyToken),
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).feeAddress(),
            feeAmount
        );
  IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transfer(
            buyInformation.owner,
            receiptID
        );
        if (buyInformation.availableAmount == 0) {
            buyInformation.isActive = false;
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).emitDelete(address(this));
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory)._deleteBuyOrder(address(this));
        } else {
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).emitUpdate(address(this));
        }
