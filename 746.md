# createBorrowOrder() is broken

### Summary

createBorrowOrder() is broken as this assumes all collaterals are erc20 token

### Root Cause

[createBorrowOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L143) allows to create borrow order for NFT as well as ERC20 tokens. Now, the issue is while checking the balanceOf(borrowOffer), it assumes that all collateral are ERC20 tokens. However it can be NFT as well as ERC20 tokens
```solidity
function createBorrowOrder(
        bool[] memory _oraclesActivated,
        uint[] memory _LTVs,
        uint _maxInterestRate,
        uint _duration,
        address[] memory _acceptedPrinciples,
        address _collateral,
        bool _isNFT,
        uint _receiptID,
        address[] memory _oracleIDS_Principles,
        uint[] memory _ratio,
        address _oracleID_Collateral,
        uint _collateralAmount
    ) external returns (address) {
///

->      uint balance = IERC20(_collateral).balanceOf(address(borrowOffer));
        require(balance >= _collateralAmount, "Invalid balance");

///
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

No

### External pre-conditions

No

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users can't create the borrow order for NFT as this will revert the transaction. This breaks the core invariant of the protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use if-else statement to check the balanceOf(borrowOffer) in case of NFT or ERC20
