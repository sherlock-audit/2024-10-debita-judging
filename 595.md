# owner address cannot be changed

### Summary

It is currently impossible to change ownership of the contracts  `DebitaV3Aggregator` , `auctionFactoryDebita`, and  `buyOrderFactory`. 

The current owner is stored in a state variable ` address public owner;` in each of the contracts mentioned above

### Root Cause

```solidity
     function changeOwner(address owner) public {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
         require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    @>    owner = owner;
    }
```
The function above is implemented in each of the aforementioned contracts above and its responsible for changing the owner to a new address  , however  the part marked  `@>` indicates that, when assigning a new address, It assigns the state  variable `owner`    back to itself.  This means even if a new address is set ,  the owner address will still remain as the deployer  ` owner = msg.sender;`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Thie `changeOwner` functions will be useless and owner address will remain the same .

### Mitigation

```diff
-      function changeOwner(address owner) public {
+       function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
   ....
-        owner = owner;
+         owner = _owner;
    }
 ```
