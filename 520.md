# NFTs sold in `buyOrder` can't be retrieved due to missing functionality

### Summary

The `buyOrder.sol` contract allows a user (`buyInformation.owner`) to deposit tokens, set a `wantedToken` (NFT) and wait for another party to sell one of his `wantedToken` to the contract using `sellNFT()`.

These NFTs are "receipts" tokens, a 1:1 representation of a "veNFT", meaning it offers a certain voting power depending on the underlying amount of tokens it holds. These receipt tokens are thus valuable.

After the NFT has been sold to the contract, the `buyInformation.owner` is supposed to retrieve the NFT from the contract.

However, this can't be done and the NFT sold will remain stuck in the `buyOrder` contract.

### Root Cause

The issue arises because the contract lacks functionality to withdraw the NFT from the contract.

```solidity
function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
    // ----- snip -----
    IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        receiptID
    );
    // ----- snip -----
    buyInformation.availableAmount -= amount;
    buyInformation.capturedAmount += collateralAmount;
    uint feeAmount = (amount *
        IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).sellFee()) / 10000;
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
        IERC20(buyInformation.buyToken),
        msg.sender,
        amount - feeAmount
    );

    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
        IERC20(buyInformation.buyToken),
        IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).feeAddress(),
        feeAmount
    );

    if (buyInformation.availableAmount == 0) {
        buyInformation.isActive = false;
        IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).emitDelete(address(this));
        IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory)._deleteBuyOrder(address(this));
    } else {
        IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).emitUpdate(address(this));
    }
}

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The contract lacks a fundamental functionality resulting in all NFTs sold to it remaining stuck with no way to be retrieved.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Add a mecanism responsible for transferring the NFT to the `buyInformation.owner`.

This can be done in 2 ways:
- add a new function the `buyInformation.owner` can call to pull the NFT from the contract (make sure to add access control)
- transfer the NFT directly to `buyInformation.owner` in the `sellNFT()` function.
