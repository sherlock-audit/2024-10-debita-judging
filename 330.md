# Borrower can force lenders to wait till `maxDeadline` to claim collaterals , if he fails to repay the debt.

### Summary

The `extendLoan` function extends the loan repay time to lender's `maxDeadline` . However, if the borrower not want to repay loan for that lender , than by leveraging the `extendLoan`  function, the borrower might restrict lender to call `createAuctionForCollateral` till `maxDeadline`.

```solidity
require(nextDeadline() < block.timestamp, "Deadline not passed");
```

### Root Cause

The borrower offer having 1 day duration and the lender offer having min duration as 1 day and max duration as 100 days is matched by the aggregator and loan created.

So if the borrower is not want/able to repay the loan before 1 day, then he might call the `extendLoan` function and can increase time for the lenders to claim the borrower's collateral till the lenders `maxDuration(maxDeadline)`.

```solidity
require(nextDeadline() < block.timestamp, "Deadline not passed");
```

### Attack Path

In this situation borrowers will just pay few amount for `extendLoan` tx, but they can forcefully allow lenders to wait till their `maxDuration` to claim borrowers collateral.

### Impact
Borrowers pays  small fee to extend the loan, exploiting the system to delay collateral claims for lenders.
The lender will have to wait too much to claim few collaterals of the borrower.

Increase the extention fee in this case.
