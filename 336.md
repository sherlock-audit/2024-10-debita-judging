# Incorrect Call Order Will Result in Lender Losing All Loan Interest

### Summary

Incorrect Call Order Will Result in Lender Losing All Loan Interest

### Root Cause

When the borrower calls **DebitaV3Loan.extendLoan**, if **lendInfo.perpetual = false**, interest will be paid to the lender, i.e., **`loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestToClaim += interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita;`**.

If the borrower exceeds the repayment date and the lender calls **DebitaV3Loan.claimCollateralAsLender** to withdraw the borrower's collateral, **`ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID);`** will be executed, removing the lender's permission. At this point, if the lender has not yet claimed the interest, calling **claimDebt** to withdraw the interest will cause a revert. The lender's loan interest will never be able to be claimed, leading to asset loss.

```solidity
    function claimDebt(uint index) external nonReentrant {
        IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);
        infoOfOffers memory offer = loanData._acceptedOffers[index];

        require(
            ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) == msg.sender,
            "Not lender"
        );
        // check if the offer has been paid, if not just call claimInterest function
        if (offer.paid) {
            _claimDebt(index);
        } else {
            // if not already full paid, claim interest
            claimInterest(index);
        }
    }
```

In **claimDebt**, it will check **`require(ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) == msg.sender, "Not lender");`**.

Since **claimCollateralAsLender** destroys the lender's permission, **claimDebt** will never succeed, causing the user to lose interest.

The code where the issue occurred[Code snippet 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L349C48-L349C48),[Code snippet 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L276)

### Internal pre-conditions

The borrower needs to call extendLoan().
The loan time nextDeadline must be less than block.timestamp, indicating the loan is overdue.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The lender will never be able to recover the interest, resulting in a loss of the interest that rightfully belongs to the lender.

### PoC


```solidity
//borrower
extendLoan()
wait nextDeadline()<block.timestamp
//lender
claimCollateralAsLender()----->取出borrower的质押品
claimDebt()-------->revert()

```





### Mitigation

The **claimCollateralAsLender** function should check if the lender has any unclaimed interest. If so, the interest should be settled before proceeding.
