# `IERC20(token).approve` will revert if the principle ERC20 token approve does not return boolean value

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

In `DebitaV3Loan`  when transferring the token, the contract uses `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` but when approving the principle token in `payDebt() and extendLoan()`, the safeApprove is not used for non-standard token such as USDT, which will make the `approve()` to revert because it doesn't return boolean. This can lead borrowers not being able to pay their debt or extend their loan which will make them subject of liquidation and then lose their collateral.

## Impact

USDT or other ERC20 token that does not return boolean for approve will revert the transaction.

## Code Snippet

[`payDebt()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L233-L236)

```solidity
    function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
           ....
           ....
           ....

            // if the lender is the owner of the offer and the offer is perpetual, then add the funds to the offer
            if (lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer) {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
    @>>            IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);
                lendOffer.addFunds(total);
            } else {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim =
                    interest -
                    feeOnInterest;
            }
           ....
           ....
    }
```

[`extendLoan()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L648)

```solidity
    function extendLoan() public {
                    .....
                    .....
                    .....
                    .....
                if (
                    lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer
                ) {
            @>>        IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer),interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita);
                    .....
                    .....
}
