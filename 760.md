# The principle in the `claimIncentives` function is not checked against a whitelist

### Summary

In the `claimIncentives` function, we directly use the principle to fetch the lent and borrowed amounts and calculate the incentives However, it's unclear whether this principle is required to be on a whitelist. This lack of verification could potentially allow malicious users to claim rewards for unapproved `principles`.

### Root Cause

Vulnerable code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L150-L151
As we can see, the `principle` provided by the user is used directly without any check to verify if it is on the whitelist. This is an oversight.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- The attacker has lent or borrowed amounts during the corresponding epoch.
- The principle provided by the attacker is not on the required whitelist.

### Attack Path

The attacker can borrow a large amount of funds and use a `principle` that is not on the whitelist to claim additional rewards.

### Impact

The  incentives claiming is unreasonable.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check to verify if the `principle` is on the whitelist.
```solidity
   for (uint i; i < principles.length; i++) {
            address principle = principles[i];

         require(isPrincipleWhitelisted[principle], "Not whitelisted");

            uint lentAmount = lentAmountPerUserPerEpoch[msg.sender][
                hashVariables(principle, epoch)
            ];
```
