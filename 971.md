# Missing Length Checks in `matchOffersV3` Function (Aggregator Contract)

### Summary

The matchOffersV3 function in the Aggregator Contract lacks explicit checks to ensure that critical input arrays,

such as `lendOrders`, `lendAmountPerOrder`, `porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder`, and others, are of consistent lengths where necessary. This missing validation introduces potential issue which can lead to
- Mismatched Inputs: Logic errors or unintended behavior if input arrays are incorrectly sized.
- Protocol Disruptions: Operations will fail mid-execution and the loan

### Impact

1. The for loop uses lendOrders.length to iterate, but the processing logic references other arrays (lendAmountPerOrder, porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder, etc.) without verifying their lengths.

  If lendOrders is shorter than other arrays then :

	• The function processes fewer iterations than necessary, leaving unprocessed orders in the longer arrays.
	• This could result in partial loans, leaving lenders or borrowers with incomplete matches.
  If lendOrders = [0x1, 0x2] and lendAmountPerOrder = [100, 200, 300], only the first two entries of lendAmountPerOrder are processed. The third entry (300) is ignored, leading to incomplete order processing.

2. Array Index Out-of-Bounds Reversion will happen If an array referenced within the loop (e.g., `lendAmountPerOrder`) is shorter than lendOrders, the function will attempt to access an index that doesn’t exist.
The transaction will revert with an “index out of bounds” error, leaving all operations unprocessed.

**Impact of Lenders and Borrowers:**
Partial matches could leave their capital idle, earning no returns for the lenders.
Borrowers Might receive less funding than requested, leading to failed objectives.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Validation at the Start of `matchOffersV3`:
```solidity
require(
    lendOrders.length == lendAmountPerOrder.length &&
    lendOrders.length == porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder.length,
    "Input arrays must have the same length"
);
```
