# getAllLoans() is implemented incorrectly.



### Summary
`getAllLoans(offset,limit)` is supposed to return all the loans from the index offset untill the limit index.

But the function can never return the last loanId even though the provided  value of limit is last loanId index.


### Root Cause

SInce `loanId` is incremented before every loanCreation , `loanId` always stores the length of the totalLoans.

`getAddressById[]` maps `loanId` -> `loanAddress` , where `loanId` starts from `1`.

```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < limit - offset; i++) {
=>          if ((i + offset + 1) >= loanID) { //@audit-issue > instead od >= because getAddressById[loanId] gives the last loan.
                break;
            }
            address loanAddress = getAddressById[i + offset + 1];

            DebitaV3Loan loan = DebitaV3Loan(loanAddress);
            loans[i] = loan.getLoanData();

            // loanIDs start at 1
        }
```
Suppose there is only 1 loan which means value of loanId = 1, and the user calls `getAllLoans(offset,limit)` where  offset = 0,limit=1

inside the loop , when i = 0, 
the check i + 0  + 1 >= loanId already passes and will break from the for loop.

The returned LoanData array now contains 0 loans.



### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

DebitaV3AggregatorContract.getAllLoans() cannot return the last loanId created. Breaks the functionality of getAllLoans().


### PoC

Just add these 3 lines at the end of testMatchOffers() function in the DebitaBasicAggregator.sol
```diff
    function testMatchOffers() public {
     ....
      + address loanCollatteral = DebitaV3AggregatorContract.getAllLoans(0,1)[0].collateral;
      + console.log("collatteral address of the created loan",loanCollatteral);
        
      + assertEq(address(0),loanCollatteral);
    } 
```
run cmd : forge test --fork-url https://mainnet.base.org --fork-block-number 21151256 --no-match-path '**Fantom**' --mt testMatchOffers

 the testMatchOffers() create and add a newlLoan with collatteral as `AERO` address.
 But, since the getAllLoans returned 0 loans , the value of loanCollatteral is 0.


### Mitigation

```solidity
    if ((i + offset + 1) > loanID) { // changed to > , so that it will cover loanId too
                    break;
                }
```
