# The ERC721 tokens transfered to buyOrder contract will be stuck in there.

### Summary

The ERC721 tokens transfered to buyOrder contract will be stuck in there. Buyer have no way to take the ERC721 token out or use them.

### Root Cause

- In [buyOrder.sol:99-103](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L99-L103C1), when a seller call `sellNFT` function, it will trigger the `IERC721.transferFrom()` function to tranfers ERC721 token from seller to buyOrder contract in stead of the `owner` of the buyOrder contract. But, this contract have no function to transfer ERC721 tokens out or implement some logic to use these token after receiving them. 

Therefore, ERC721 tokens transfered to this contract will be stuck.

```diff
        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
-           address(this),
+           owner,
            receiptID
        );
```

- Or, implement some more logic to use these tokens after receiving them.
