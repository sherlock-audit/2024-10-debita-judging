# The borrower unable to pay their debt at deadline resulting to undesired liquidation.




### Summary

Borrower cannot pay the debt of an offer even though `nextDeadline()` >= `block.timestamp`.
Hence the borrwer will lose all his collateral even if he attempt to pay his debt on the `deadline` timestamp.


### Root Cause

A borrower should be able to pay their debt untill the timestamp = `nextDeadline()`.
It has been enforced correctly before looping through each offers.

[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L194-L197)
```solidity
        require(
            nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp,
            "Deadline passed to pay Debt"
        );
```

But inside the for loop, where the validity of each offers is checked ,  if the block.timestamp == nextDeadline() it will incorrectly revert with "Deadline Passed" message.
[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L210)
```solidity
    require(offer.maxDeadline > block.timestamp, "Deadline passed");
```

`nextDeadline()` always returns the deadline of the offer.
 Its maximum value can be `offer.maxDeadline` in 2 cases -

1. if a borrower specified borrowOrder.duration and  that borrowOrder got matched with an offer having the offer.maxDeadline = borrowOrder.duration.

2. If a borrower chose to extend the Loan.

So,in these 2 cases, users cannot pay their debt and they dont have anyother chance to pay since its the deadline.

As a result, deviating from the expected behaviour , the borrower is restricted from paying their debt. Hence , loan is forced to get liquidated from the next timestamp.

In the BasicDebitaAggregator.t.sol , make these changes

in the `setUp()`
```diff

changes in the `testMatchOffersAndCheckParams()`
