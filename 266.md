# Users can add funds to expired non-perpetual lending offers, leading to fund mismanagement

### Summary

The absence of a timestamp check in the `addFunds` function will cause improper fund management for lenders, as users can add funds to non-perpetual lending offers even after the `maxDuration` has passed.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162-L176, the `addFunds` function does not verify if the current timestamp is less than `maxDuration` for non-perpetual lending offers. This omission allows users to add funds to offers that have already expired.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The lending offer has perpetual set to false.
2. The current block timestamp is greater than maxDuration (i.e., the offer has expired).
3. Users have access to call the addFunds function.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The lending offer is created with `perpetual = false` and a specific maxDuration.
2. Time passes, and the current block timestamp exceeds `maxDuration`, causing the offer to expire.
3. A user calls the addFunds function on the expired non-perpetual lending offer.
4. The function accepts the funds without checking if the offer has expired.
5. Funds are added to the expired lending offer, potentially leading to locked funds or mismanagement.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from improper fund management as users can add funds to expired non-perpetual lending offers, potentially leading to locked funds or inconsistencies in offer states.

### PoC

```solidity
// Assume we have an instance of the non-perpetual lending offer contract
DebitaLendOffer lendOffer = DebitaLendOffer(nonPerpetualLendingOfferAddress);

// Check that the offer is non-perpetual
require(!lendOffer.perpetual(), "Offer is perpetual");

// Fast forward time to exceed maxDuration
uint256 maxDuration = lendOffer.maxDuration();
vm.warp(block.timestamp + maxDuration + 1);

// Attempt to add funds to the expired offer
uint256 amountToAdd = 1000 ether;
lendOffer.addFunds(amountToAdd);

// The addFunds function does not check if the offer has expired
// Funds are accepted and added to the expired lending offer
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
function addFunds(uint256 amount) external {
    if (!perpetual) {
        require(block.timestamp < maxDuration, "Lending offer has expired");
    }
    require(isActive, "Lending offer is not active");
    // Rest of the function logic
}
```
