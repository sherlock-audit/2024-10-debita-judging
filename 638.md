# The lack of GAP between borrowOffer.duration and loanOrder.maxDuration can result in extendLoan function being useless.

### Summary

Let’s understand how the loan deadline behaves.

Until the user calls extendLoan - that deadline is startedAt + borrowOffer.duration
However, if the borrower called extendLoan - that deadline is the smallest of maxDeadlines for unpaid loans.
```solidity
function nextDeadline() public view returns (uint) {
        uint _nextDeadline;
        LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
        if (m_loan.extended) {
            for (uint i; i < m_loan._acceptedOffers.length; i++) {
                if (
                    _nextDeadline == 0 &&
                    m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].paid == false
                ) {
                    _nextDeadline = m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].maxDeadline;
                } else if (
                    m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].paid == false &&
                    _nextDeadline > m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].maxDeadline
                ) {
                    _nextDeadline = m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].maxDeadline;
                }
            }
        } else {
            _nextDeadline = m_loan.startedAt + m_loan.initialDuration;
        }
        return _nextDeadline;
    }
```

The name extendLoan function implies that the deadline should be increased.
However let’s see how maxDeadline is considered for each Loan, this can be seen in the `matchOffersV3` function
```solidity
            require(
                borrowInfo.duration >= lendInfo.minDuration &&
                    borrowInfo.duration <= lendInfo.maxDuration,
                "Invalid duration"
            );
            ....
            offers[i] = DebitaV3Loan.infoOfOffers({
                principle: lendInfo.principle,
                lendOffer: lendOrders[i],
                principleAmount: lendAmountPerOrder[i],
                lenderID: lendID,
                apr: lendInfo.apr,
                ratio: ratio,
                collateralUsed: userUsedCollateral,
                maxDeadline: lendInfo.maxDuration + block.timestamp,
                paid: false,
                collateralClaimed: false,
                debtClaimed: false,
                interestToClaim: 0,
                interestPaid: 0
            });
```
So, we see that [maxDuration can be equal to borrowInfo.duration](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L432)

Since we take the minimum of all maxDeadline - it is enough to have only one loan whose duration == maxDuration for extendLoan function to be useless.

Given that the call of matchOffersV3 function can any borrower and do not control which lendOrders will be selected for their loan - they can have no influence on such situation.

it’s not fair to the borrowers.

### Root Cause

maxDeadline can be equal to normal deadline

### Internal pre-conditions
borrower created a borrow offer.

Someone matches it with orders that have at least one maxDuration = duration.

In this case the extendLoans function is useless for borrower

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

I think this kind of failure slightly offends the logic of the protocol and makes extendLoan function useless in some cases.

Given that borrowers do not control which lendOrders they will catch - it is clearly unfair to the borrower.

medium severity

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I think it would be nice to add a gap field in the borrowOffer - which shows the minimum time between the deadline and the nearest maxDeadline. This borrower will avoid such cases.
