# After the buyOrder is completed, the order creator does not receive the NFT

### Summary

After sellNFT is completed, the NFT should be transferred  to the order creator, but this is not done.

### Root Cause

After the buyOrder is completed, the order creator does not receive the NFT, and the NFT is sent directly to **[buyOrderContract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L99)**

The latter only emits an event and deletes the order, but does not transfer the NFT to  the order creator

### Internal pre-conditions



### External pre-conditions

1. User A  create buyOrder.
2. User B  **sellNFT**.

### Attack Path
1. User A  create buyOrder.
2. User B  **sellNFT**,and [receive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L122) **buyToken**
3.  But **order creator** will[ lose ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L99)the NFT


### Impact

The buyOrder creator will lose the NFT

### PoC

```solidity
function testpoc() public{
        vm.startPrank(seller);
        receiptContract.approve(address(buyOrderContract), receiptID);
        uint balanceBeforeAero = AEROContract.balanceOf(seller);
        address owner = receiptContract.ownerOf(receiptID);
       
        console.log("receipt owner before sell",owner);


        buyOrderContract.sellNFT(receiptID);
        address owner1 = receiptContract.ownerOf(receiptID);
        console.log("receipt owner after sell",owner1);
        //owner = buyOrderContract
        assertEq(owner1,address(buyOrderContract));
