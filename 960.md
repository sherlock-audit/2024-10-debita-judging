# Calling `changePerpetual()` can result in `deleteOrder()` being called, but failling to disactivate the order.

### Summary

When `changePerpetual(false)` is called for a loan with `availableAmount == 0` the order is removed, because it means that the lender changed their mind about accumulating the interest in the order contract:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L182-L184
The issue is that it fails at disactivating the order permanently which is the opposite of what `deleteOrder()` does.

### Root Cause

The `isActive` flag is not set to false in `changePerpetual()` when `availableAmount` is `0` and `perpetual` is `false`.

### Internal pre-conditions

- a lend order that was perpetual and utilized all available amount for a match is set to non-perpetual

### External pre-conditions

--

### Attack Path

1. Valid lend offer is created with perpetual set to `true`. 
2. It's matched with a borrow order utilizing all of the available amount.
3. Owner changes their mind and decides to make the order non-perpetual.
4. Owner can call `addFunds()`, `updateLendOffer()` and `acceptLendingOffer()` to utilize the same contract again.



### Impact

Core functionality not working - a canceled offer can still be used. 


### PoC

Change this to `true` to set the lend offer as perpetual:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/test/local/Loan/TwoLendersERC20Loan.t.sol#L143
and the following to `0` - for simplicity we are creating lend order with available amount `0` as if it was used already matched:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/test/local/Loan/TwoLendersERC20Loan.t.sol#L155


The add this test case to `TwoLendersERC20Loan.t.sol`:
```solidity
    function test_changePerpetual() public {
        LendOrder.changePerpetual(false);
        DLOImplementation.LendInfo memory lendInformation = LendOrder.getLendInfo();
        assertEq(lendInformation.perpetual, false);
        assertEq(lendInformation.availableAmount, 0);
        assertEq(LendOrder.isActive(), true);
    }
```

This is very minimalistic to show the impact for this root cause. Separate finding shows how `addFunds()` (and other functions) can be called for deleted order.


### Mitigation

Consider the following change to the `changePerpetual()` function:
```diff
function changePerpetual(bool _perpetual) public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        require(isActive, "Offer is not active");

        lendInformation.perpetual = _perpetual;
        if (_perpetual == false && lendInformation.availableAmount == 0) {
+           isActve = false;
            IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
            IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
        } else {
            IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
        }
    }
```
Which is similar to what `acceptLendingOffer()` does under similar conditions.
