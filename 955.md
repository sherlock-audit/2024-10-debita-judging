# Ineffective Owner Transfer in Factory Contracts

### Summary

Variable shadowing in changeOwner functions in auction and buy order factories will cause ownership transfers to fail for protocol deployers as new contract deployments will be unable to transfer ownership within the required 6-hour window.
 

### Root Cause

In auctionFactoryDebita.sol  at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218 and buyOrderFactory.sol, the parameter shadowing in changeOwner functions:
solidityCopyfunction changeOwner(address owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner; // State variable shadowed by parameter
}

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path


1. Contract is deployed by initial owner
2. Within 6 hours, owner calls changeOwner() with new owner address
3. Transaction succeeds but state owner variable remains unchanged
4. 6-hour window expires without successful ownership transfer

### Impact

The protocol deployers cannot execute ownership transfers within the required 6-hour window after deployment.
