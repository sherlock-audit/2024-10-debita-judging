### Attack Path

Within the `DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3` function, the price is calculated using USD-nominated pair with 8 decimal precision. If the price returned from the Pyth oracle is not 8 decimals, the calculation will be incorrect, which lead to the ratio/price to be inflated or deflated.

Following is the extract from [Pyth's documentation](https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm/getPriceNoOlderThan), which shows the price data returned from Pyth oracle. The price data consists of the exponent (or decimal) of the price returned.

> The price object contains the following fields:
>
> 1. `price`: The latest price of the price feed.
> 2. `conf`: The confidence level of the price feed.
> 3. `expo`: The exponent of the price feed.
> 4. `publishtime`: The time when the price feed was last updated.
>
> Sample `price` object:
>
> ```
> {
>     price: 123456789n,
>     conf: 180726074n,
>     expo: -8,
>     publishTime: 1721765108n
> }
> ```
>
> The `price` above is in the format of `price * 10^expo`. So, the `price` in above mentioned sample represents the number `123456789 * 10(-8) = 1.23456789` in this case.

However, the issue is that the `DebitaPyth` assumes that the price returned from Pyth is always 8 decimals. This assumption is invalid.

For instance, the price of BTT tokens (id = Crypto.BTT/USD (0x097d687437374051c75160d648800f021086bc8edf469f11284491fda8192315)) returned by Pyth Oracle is in 10 decimals precision.

```solidity
{
    price: 8851n,
    conf: 39n,
    expo: -10,
    publishTime: 1727961560n
}
```

As a result, the calculated price/ratio will be inflated or deflated. When the price/ratio of collateral/principle tokens is incorrect, more or less collateral/principle tokens within the lending/borrow offers will be matched, resulting in a loss for the lender or borrower.

For instance, if the collateral price within the borrow offer is inflated, the protocol will assume that the borrow offer contains collateral that is worth much more than expected and allow them to borrow more principle than expected from the lenders, resulting in a loss for the affected lenders.

27:         bytes32 _priceFeed = priceIdPerToken[tokenAddress];
28:         require(_priceFeed != bytes32(0), "Price feed not set");
29:         require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
30: 
31:         // Get the price from the pyth contract, no older than 90 seconds
32:         PythStructs.Price memory priceData = pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan(
33:             _priceFeed,
34:             600
35:         );
36: 
37:         // Check if the price feed is available and the price is valid
38:         require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
39:         require(priceData.price > 0, "Invalid price");
40:         return priceData.price;
41:     }
```

### Impact

High. As a result, the calculated price/ratio will be inflated or deflated. When the price/ratio of collateral/principle tokens is incorrect, more or less collateral/principle tokens within the lending/borrow offers will be matched, resulting in a loss for the lender or borrower.

For instance, if the collateral price within the borrow offer is inflated, the protocol will assume that the borrow offer contains collateral that is worth much more than expected and allow them to borrow more principle than expected from the lenders, resulting in a loss for the affected lenders.

### Mitigation

Verify the price data's exponent and scale the price to 8 decimals if needed if the returned `price.expo` is not 8.
