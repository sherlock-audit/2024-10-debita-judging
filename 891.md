# NTF lockedDate should be checked when creating borrow offer

### Summary

The veNFT's lockedDate should be checked against the borrow duration before creating a borrow offer.

### Root Cause

Borrowers can create borrow offer by collateralizing their NFT receipts. The NFT receipts can be minted by depositing veNFTs,  where these veNFTs are minted from locking underlying tokens.  Locking usually persists a period time, and during which one can not withdraw their underlying tokens. 
Since the borrowers use receipt NFT as collaterall to borrow, if the locked end dates are not checked , they can potentially withdraw their underlying tokens right after the borrower offer created.

### Attack Path

Borrower locked his underlying tokens with a relatively short time duration to mint veNFT.
Borrower deposit veNTF to Receipt-veNFT contract to mint receipt nft.
Borrower creates borrowing offer against his receipt collateral. 
Borrower quickly withdraw his underlying tokens,  after loan default, lenders will bear loss since there is no value in receipt.

### Impact

Lenders wiil suffer loss if the borrower can withdraw his underlying tokens right after borrowing offer creation.

### Mitigation

consider add check for lockedData during borrow offer initialization.
DBOImplementation:: initialize
```diff
function  initialize(...) {
    ...
        if (_isNFT) {
            NFR.receiptInstance memory nftData = NFR(_collateral)
                .getDataByReceipt(_receiptID);
            _startedBorrowAmount = nftData.lockedAmount; //@audit the locked.date should > duration
            _valuableAsset = nftData.underlying; 
+       require(nftData.lockedData>block.timestamp + _duration);
        } else {
            _valuableAsset = _collateral;
        }

...

}
