# Lack of Rate Limiting in `matchOffersV3` Enables Fee Monopolization and Borrower Exploitation

### Summary

The absence of rate limiting in the `matchOffersV3` function in the Aggregator contract allows a single user to monopolize the connector fee structure, repeatedly claiming fees for themselves. Borrowers can also exploit this by matching their own offers and redirecting the connector fees back to their wallet, undermining the fairness of the protocol.

### Root Cause

The `matchOffersV3` 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274

function does not include any mechanism to prevent the same user or borrower from repeatedly calling the function in a short span. There is no tracking or limitation of how many times a specific user or borrower can invoke the function to match offers and earn connector fees.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.	Fee Monopolization:
	•	A single user continually calls matchOffersV3 to match various offers, ensuring they always earn the connector fees.
	•	Other users are excluded from participating or earning fees due to the high frequency of these transactions.
2.	Borrower Exploitation:
	•	A borrower creates both lending and borrowing offers.
	•	They repeatedly call matchOffersV3 to match their own offers, ensuring the connector fees are funneled back to their wallet.

### Impact

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1.	Implement Rate Limiting:
	•	Introduce a cooldown period between successive calls to matchOffersV3 by the same user.
	•	Use time-based or transaction count-based limits to ensure fair access to the function.
2.	Restrict Borrower-Connector Overlap:
	•	Add a check to prevent borrowers from acting as the connector for their own offers.
	•	Ensure the connector fee cannot be claimed by the borrower of a matched offer.
3.	Randomized Fee Distribution:
	•	Use a weighted random distribution mechanism to reward connector fees among multiple eligible users instead of a single one dominating.
