# NFR Collateral could be locked inside the auction contract indefinitely because the liquidation auction do not allow adjustment to its floor price.

### Vulnerability Detail

There are cases that a particular token can shoot up its price in single day and these incidents can affect the price of auctioned collateral NFR. Auctioned collateral NFR price is dependent on quantity of its [underlying token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L473-L474) of veNFT (veAero) in this case is Aero tokens. If the usd price of Aero tokens increased in very high level like 2x or 10x from the original value when the auction started, it can affect the buyer sentiments and left the auctioned NFR unsold for a long period of time.

Usually when this case happened, the auction owner need to update the price depending on market condition. He can edit the floor price to make it affordable for large group of willing buyers. In this price adjustment, this can increase the chance that the auctioned NFR to be sold for short period of time. Lenders will be able to claim the proceeds from the sale of collateral.

However, in the current setup of the protocol, the auctioned collateral NFR price is fixed once it reaches the floor price. For example, if the floor price of auctioned NFR is 1,000 aero tokens (1 usd per aero token when it hits the floor price), the usd value is 1,000 usd. But the question is, what if the usd price of aero increase significantly like 10x in the next day? The buyers will definitely delay the purchase and need to wait longer until the market condition become affordable again. So in this kind of incident, the auction owner will adjust the floor price to make it more affordable, but the [editfloorprice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L192-L226) is not available to be accessed by loan contract which is the owner of auction. [Loan contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L85) has no function that allows it to access the editfloorprice, that's why we have issue.

### Root Cause

During liquidation auction process, the [auction owner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L85) which is the [loan contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L470-L477) has no capability to adjust the floor price of auctioned collateral NFR once the price hit the floor price. This can be problematic because the floor price is fixed to the "[quantity of underlying tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L475)" of veNFT (veAero) in this case, the Aero tokens. If the usd price of each Aero token increase significantly, this can affect the selling of auctioned collateral NFR. Buyers will wait for longer until market becomes affordable again and this will delay the lenders to claim the proceeds of collateral sale.

Here is the editFloorPrice function that supposed to be use to adjust the floor price of the auctioned NFR. However, the owner of auction contract which is the loan contract has no available function to access the editfloorprice. Therefore, the price can't be adjusted when there is significant price increase in Aero tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

USD Price of underlying token increase significantly since the auction started.

### Attack Path

This can be the scenario:

### Impact

The collateral is locked indefinitely depending on market conditions. This could take weeks or months to remain unsold if the price is still high. If remain unsold, this would technically mean , the lenders can't able to recover their proceeds from sale.


### PoC

See attack path for steps

### Mitigation

The protocol should give the auction owner which is the loan contract the capability to adjust the floor price of auctioned NFR collateral during unpredictable sudden increase of underlying token price. Defi market condition is hard to predict so the protocol should be always prepared and able to adjust when that time happens to prevent damages to the lenders who are waiting sale proceeds of the NFR.
