# The `createBuyOrder()` function lacks the necessary parameters to properly buy a veNFT

### Summary

In the [`buyOrderFactory::createBuyOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L75) function, users can create an order to buy a specific type of NFT (e.g., veAERO or veEQUAL). Once the order is created, owners of these NFTs can [sell them](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92) through the `buyOrder` instance that has been created.


The issue arises during the selling process. The function only considers the [amount locked](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L108) in the NFT, ignoring the [lock duration](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/Receipt-veNFT.sol#L30). 

This oversight is significant, as a user could receive two veNFTs with the same locked amount but drastically different lock durations (e.g., one locked for 1 week and another locked for 4 years) while paying the same price. Accounting for lock duration is crucial to ensure fair valuation in the `buyOrder` process.

### Root Cause

Lack of lock duration params in `createBuyOrder` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Alice owns a veAERO:
- Locked amount: 10,000 AERO
- Locked duration: 1 year
- Voting power: 2,500 AERO

Bob owns another veAERO:
- Locked amount: 10,000 AERO
- Locked duration: 4 years
- Voting power: 10,000 AERO

John creates a buy order to purchase a veAERO:
- Available amount: 10,000 AERO
- Desired token: veAERO

John wants a veAERO with a short duration to redeem as soon as possible and obtain AERO tokens. However, Bob sees the offer first and sells his veAERO for the requested amount (calculated based on the ratio, omitted here for simplicity). Since John has no way to specify that he wants a veAERO with a short duration, he ends up with a veAERO locked for 4 years. As users can normally extend the duration of a veAERO but not shorten it, John is unable to adjust the duration to meet his needs.

### Impact

- A user can pay the same amount of tokens for a veNFT with different duration lock.
- Undesired veNFT acquisition.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the desired lock parameters in the `createBuyOrder()` function, and implement the necessary calculations in `sellNFT()` to select the appropriate veNFT based on the lock duration.
- Proposed Solution:
       - Specify the minimum and maximum duration parameters for the NFT you intend to purchase.
