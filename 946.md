# if a user does not have up to 1 of 10_000 of the borrows or loans of an epoch, they will lose all rewards for that epoch

### Summary

assuming 10 million tokens was lent or borrowed in a particular epoch and a user acounnt lent 5000 tokens in that same epoch 

assuming total rewards is 10th 

then the user rewards for that epoch should be 5_000e18  * 10e18/ 10_000_000e18 = 5e16 or 0.05eth 
however due to solidity rounding issues 
this line of code would resolve to zero 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L161 

leaving the user will zero percent while the user should have 0.05% of the total amount 

so when calculating the final value it would be 10e18 * 0 / 10_000 which is zero

as a result the user will not be able to collect the incentives and they will be left in the contract

### Mitigation

use a higher percentage factor like 1e18 or 1e27 
for example with 1e18 the users percentege would be 5e14 
when calculating the final amount, it would evaluate to 
10e18 * 5e14/ 1e18 = 5000000000000000 allowing the user to claim their 0.05 eth
