# veNFT's actual owner may lose some veNFT associated benefits in veNFTAerodrome

### Summary

In veAERO, veAERO holders can get bribe rewards and fee rewards. We miss claiming fee rewards in veNFTAerodrome. If this NFT is sold, the previous veAERO holder will lose these fee rewards.

### Root Cause

In [Debita website](https://debita-finance.gitbook.io/debita-v3/receipts/venfts), it mentions that `By locking your veNFT, you retain all associated benefits such as voting power, rewards claiming, and lock extensions. `
In AERO protocol, veAERO holders can get bribe rewards and fee rewards. The problem is that we only claim bribe rewads via [claimBribes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/veNFTAerodrome.sol#L151). when we integrate with AERO protocol, we don't claim fee rewards via `claimFees`. This will cause that the borrowers cannot claim their veAERO's fee rewards. Once this veAERO receipt is in one auction, and is sold. The borrower will lose these fee rewards.
```solidity
    function claimBribes(address[] memory _bribes, address[][] memory _tokens, uint256 _tokenId) external {
        if (!IVotingEscrow(ve).isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), _tokenId)) revert NotApprovedOrOwner();
        uint256 _length = _bribes.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _length; i++) {
            IReward(_bribes[i]).getReward(_tokenId, _tokens[i]);
        }
    }
    /// @inheritdoc IVoter
    function claimFees(address[] memory _fees, address[][] memory _tokens, uint256 _tokenId) external {
        if (!IVotingEscrow(ve).isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), _tokenId)) revert NotApprovedOrOwner();
        uint256 _length = _fees.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _length; i++) {
            IReward(_fees[i]).getReward(_tokenId, _tokens[i]);
        }
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

1. Borrowers create receipt via veAERO.
2. Borrowers don't pay debt timely. This veAERO's receipt is sold to another people.
3. Borrowers will lose the previous fee rewards.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The borrowers will lose some fee rewards. This break the protocol's design intension, `By locking your veNFT, you retain all associated benefits such as voting power, rewards claiming, and lock extensions.`

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

In veNFTAerodrome, add one interface to claim fee rewards from veAERO.
