# `AuctionFactory::changeOwner` Fails to Update Contract Ownership Due to Variable Shadowing

### Summary

The `changeOwner` function in the `AuctionFactory` contract does not correctly transfer ownership because the function parameter `owner` shadows the contract's state variable `owner`. This leads to the ownership transfer logic being ineffective.
Note that the same bug exists inside `DebitaV3Aggregator::changeOwner` function.

### Root Cause
In [AuctionFactory.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218), The `changeOwner` function has a parameter named `owner` that shadows the contract's state variable `owner`. Inside the function, the assignment `owner = owner;` incorrectly references the local parameter instead of updating the state variable.

Relevant code snippet from `AuctionFactory.sol`:
```javascript
address owner; // owner of the contract
.
.
.
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner;
}
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. **Ownership Cannot Be Transferred:** The state variable `owner` remains unchanged, making the ownership transfer functionality ineffective.
2. **Access Control Risk:** Since the function does not update the `owner` state variable, it could confuse contract administrators and create vulnerabilities in future integrations.
3. **Partial Exploitability:** Anyone can call this function with their own address as the input, bypassing the `require(msg.sender == owner)` check. However, no actual ownership change occurs due to the broken logic.


### PoC

A test illustrating the issue:
```solidity
function testChangeOwner() public {
    assertEq(factory.owner(), owner); // owner should be set initially
    address newOwner = makeAddr("newOwner");

    vm.startPrank(owner);
    vm.expectRevert(); // Function will revert because `owner` remains unchanged
    factory.changeOwner(newOwner);

    assertEq(factory.owner(), owner); // owner state variable is not updated
}
```

### Mitigation

Refactor the function to use a non-shadowing parameter name, ensuring the correct state variable is updated.
```diff
function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
-   owner = owner;
+   owner = _owner;
}
```
