### Attack Path

Assume the following:

- decimalsToken0 (EQUAL) = 6 decimals
- decimalsToken1 (XYZ) = 18 decimals

The `twapPrice112x112` is computed by taking the reserve/balance of both tokens (EQUAL and XYZ) in the pool, dividing them, and scaling up by Q112 (2* 112), as shown below.

The price/ratio will be token1 per token0, which will be XYZ per EQUAL.

```solidity
File: TarotPriceOracle.sol
33:     function getPriceCumulativeCurrent(
34:         address uniswapV2Pair
35:     ) internal view returns (uint256 priceCumulative) {
36:         priceCumulative = IUniswapV2Pair(uniswapV2Pair)
37:             .reserve0CumulativeLast();
38:         (
39:             uint112 reserve0, // @audit-info EQUAL
40:             uint112 reserve1, // @audit-info XYZ
41:             uint32 _blockTimestampLast
42:         ) = IUniswapV2Pair(uniswapV2Pair).getReserves();
43:         uint224 priceLatest = UQ112x112.encode(reserve1).uqdiv(reserve0); // @audit-info XYZ divided by EQUAL
```

Assume that the current market price/ratio is 10 million (10e6) XYZ per EQUAL. In this case, `twapPrice112x112` will be equal to `(10e6/1e18 * (2**112))`, as shown below.

```solidity
twapPrice112x112 (XYZ per EQUAL) = XYZ/EQUAL (XYZ divided by EQUAL) = 10e6 XYZ per EQUAL = (10e6 * 1e18)/1e6 = (10e24/1e6 * (2**112)) scaled up by 112
```

Next, the `amountOfAttached` will be computed at Line 61 below via the following formula to obtain the price/ratio for EQUAL per XYZ. This means that 0.1 EQUAL per XYZ, which is correct.

```solidity
amountOfAttached = ((2**112) * (10**decimalsToken1)) / twapPrice112x112
amountOfAttached = ((2**112) * (10**18)) / (10e24/1e6 * (2**112))
amountOfAttached = (1e18) / (10e24/1e6) = 0.1 = 0 (Solidity Round Down)
```

```solidity
File: MixOracle.sol
53:         // Get the price from the pyth contract, no older than 20 minutes
54:         // get usd price of token0
55:         int attachedTokenPrice = IPyth(debitaPythOracle).getThePrice(attached); // @audit-info attached => XYZ | USD per XYZ | How much in terms of USD each XYZ is worth
56:         uint decimalsToken1 = ERC20(attached).decimals(); // @audit-info From Pyth | XYZ's decimal = 18
57:         uint decimalsToken0 = ERC20(tokenAddress).decimals(); // @audit-info From Tarot | EQUAL's decimal = 18
58: 
59:         // calculate the amount of attached token that is needed to get 1 token1
60:         int amountOfAttached = int(
61:             (((2 ** 112)) * (10 ** decimalsToken1)) / twapPrice112x112 // @audit-info 1 XYZ / (EQUAL per XYZ) => Become XYZ per EQUAL
62:         );
63: 
64:         // calculate the price of 1 token1 in usd based on the attached token
65:         uint price = (uint(amountOfAttached) * uint(attachedTokenPrice)) /
66:             (10 ** decimalsToken1);
67: 
68:         require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
```

However, the `amountOfAttached` will round down to zero, and cause a revert in Line 68 above.

Thus, in an edge case where a high-value token is paired with a low-value token (e.g., XYZ and EQUAL in the above scenario), the price oracle will always revert.

This can happen in real-life scenarios, and many token pairs exhibit this characteristic. Some examples of such token pairs are:

- WBTC<>SHIBA, where the ratio/price is around 3.7 billion SHIBA per WBTC
- ETH<>SHIBA, where the ratio/price is around 125 million SHIBA per ETH
- ETH<>SAFEMOON, where the ratio/price is around 100 million SAFEMOON per ETH

### Impact

High. Loss of assets and breaking core contract functionality

The following are the negative impacts of this issue:

- (Most severe impact) Loss of assets. In the above example, if the price is an initial 9 million (9e6) XYZ per EQUAL, the price will operate normally and issue a Loan. When the price goes beyond 10 million (10e6) XYZ per EQUAL, all auctions will break due to the oracle reverts, leading to defaulted collateral not being able to be auctioned off and lenders not being repaid. 
- Breaking core contract functionality. Price oracle is broken.
