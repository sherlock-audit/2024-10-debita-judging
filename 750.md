### Attack Path

1. User calls the function `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan` to extend the time  for the loan.
2. Let's take the params as , `offer.maxDeadline = 200` , `alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt = 150 - 80 = 70`
3. Hence while calculating the `extendedTime` the execution will get failed `extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - alreadyUsedTime -block.timestamp=200 - 70 - 150(Overflow)`
4. Hence in some cases user will not able to extend there loan.

### Impact

In some cases user will not be able to extend there loan.

### PoC
