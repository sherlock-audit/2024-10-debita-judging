# Funds can be added to inactive Loan offers

### Summary

The missing require statement for `isActive` in `DebitaLendOffers-Implementation::addFunds` will allow funds to be added to offers that are not active.

### Root Cause

in `DebitaLendOffers-Implementation::162` the function does not implement a check to verify if the offer is active.

### Impact

Funds can be added to an inactive offer, but borrowers cannot interact with it (e.g., take loans), leading to locked funds that cannot serve their intended purpose.
