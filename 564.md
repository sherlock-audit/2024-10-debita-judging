### Attack Path

The [Debita documentation](https://debita-finance.gitbook.io/debita-v3/lending/incentives) contains a detailed explanation of the Incentive mechanism.

In summary, the amount of incentive each user can receive depends on the total number of tokens that they have borrowed or lent in each epoch (one epoch = 14 days).

Assume that the incentive for borrowing a principle token called $P$ is 10 WETH, 10 WETH, 10 WETH for Epoch 101, Epoch 102, and Epoch 103, respectively. In this case, if Alice borrows 30 USDC and Bob borrows 70 USDC in Epoch 101, Alice will be able to claim 3 WETH, while Bob will be able to claim 7 WETH. The distribution of incentives per epoch is purely based on the proportion.

```solidity
File: DebitaIncentives.sol
142:     function claimIncentives(
..SNIP..
177:             for (uint j = 0; j < tokensIncentives[i].length; j++) {
178:                 address token = tokensIncentives[i][j];
179:                 uint lentIncentive = lentIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch[principle][
180:                     hashVariables(token, epoch)
181:                 ];
182:                 uint borrowIncentive = borrowedIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch[
183:                     principle
184:                 ][hashVariables(token, epoch)];
..SNIP..
200:                 uint amountToClaim = (lentIncentive * porcentageLent) / 10000;
201:                 amountToClaim += (borrowIncentive * porcentageBorrow) / 10000;
```

However, the issue is that malicious users can match their own orders a few seconds before the Epoch ends and withdraw the Loan immediately a few seconds after the new Epoch starts. For instance:

- On `Epoch 101 - 3 seconds` - Bob matches his own lend and borrow orders, and borrows 1000 $P$ token. As a result, `borrowedIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch[P][hash(WETH, Epoch 101)] = 1000 P`
- On `Epoch 102 + 3 seconds` - Bob's Loan deadline has been reached, and he can claim back all the collateral.
- On `Epoch 102 + 3 seconds` - Bob can claim 1000 $P$ worth of incentive from Epoch 101, depending on his proportion against the rest of the users.

Alternatively, if Bob is not well-funded, he can leverage a flash loan to create a borrow-and-loan order with zero duration. The protocol does not prevent zero duration during the creation of a borrow/loan order and also does not impose a minimum duration for the Loan to be created. Thus, this is technically possible. After Bob matches his own orders, `borrowedIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch[P][hash(WETH, Epoch 101)] = 1000 P` and he can claim the incentive in the next Epoch.

The fee to be paid depends on the following formula below. In the worst-case scenario, the highest possible fee is only 1.0%. If Bob borrows 1000 $P$, he would only need to pay a maximum of 10 $P$ in the worst-case scenario. In reality, he will be paying the minimum fee (e.g., 0.1%) because the duration is so short and `percentage` computed will always be lower than the `minFee`.

Assuming a worst-case scenario. At the last block or last few seconds, Bob can fetch the total borrow amount in the current epoch. From here, he determines, based on the current total borrow amount, whether or not it is profitable to carry out the attack. If the incentive gain is larger than 10 $P$ (1.0%) he paid as a fee, he will proceed with the attack. Obviously, this will be done automatically via bots/scripts.

The rest of the innocent users will be affected by Bob's "just-in-time" attack, as Bob will dilute their proportion in the epoch, leading to the victim claiming a smaller proportion of the incentive and a loss of funds for the victims.

```solidity
feePerDay = From 1 to 10 (0.01% to 0.1%)

uint percentage = ((borrowInfo.duration * feePerDay) / 86400);

// fix the percentage of the fees
if (percentage > maxFEE) { // @audit-info maxFEE = 0.5% to 1.0%
    percentage = maxFEE;
}

if (percentage < minFEE) { // @audit-info minFEE = 0.1% to 0.5%
    percentage = minFEE;
}

uint feeToPay = (amountPerPrinciple[i] * percentage) / 10000;
```

### Impact

High. Innocent users will be affected by Bob's "just-in-time" attack, as Bob will dilute their proportion in the epoch, leading to the victim claiming a smaller proportion of the incentive and a loss of funds for the victims.
