# Unsafe transfer functions are used to transfer ERC20 tokens without checking the transfer result.

### Summary

[`DebitaIncentives.sol:claimIncentives`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L203) and [`DebitaIncentives.sol:incentivizePair`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L269) use `transfer` and `transferFrom` to transfer tokens, but they did not check the transfer result. The impacts are:
1. If the `transfer` in `claimIncentives` fails, users will not be able to reclaim them and will lose their incentives.
2. If the `transferFrom` in `incentivizePair` fails, the incentives per token per epoch will still increase and will impact users' incentives.

### Root Cause

`transfer` and `transferFrom` return a boolean value indicating whether the transfer is successful or not. However, the `claimIncentives` and `incentivizePair` functions do not check the result of the transfer.

### Impact

1. If the `transfer` in `claimIncentives` fails, users will not be able to reclaim them and will lose their incentives.
2. If the `transferFrom` in `incentivizePair` fails, the incentives per token per epoch will still increase and will impact users' incentives.

### Mitigation

Use `SafeERC20.safeTransfer` and `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` to transfer ERC20 tokens.
