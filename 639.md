# Insufficient validation of L2 sequencer data feed in `DebitaChainlink::checkSequencer()`

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L50-L51

The project will be deployed on few different L2 networks (Base, Arbitrum, Optimism). Since the protocol implements some checks for the `sequencerUptimeFeed` status, the `DebitaChainlink::checkSequencer()` should check if the `startedAt` attribute is zero to ensure that the L2 sequencer's status is up to date.

### Root Cause

```solidity
DebitaChainlink

function checkSequencer() public view returns (bool) {
@>  (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, , ) = sequencerUptimeFeed
        .latestRoundData();

    // Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
    // Answer == 1: Sequencer is down
    bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
@>  if (!isSequencerUp) {
        revert SequencerDown();
    }
    console.logUint(startedAt);
    // Make sure the grace period has passed after the
    // sequencer is back up.
@>  uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
@>  if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
        revert GracePeriodNotOver();
    }

    return true;
}
```

There are checks for `answer` and `startedAt`, but the protocol assumes that the `startedAt` can't be zero which is not true for all L2 networks according to the official documentation - [Chainlink L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code).

> startedAt: This timestamp indicates when the sequencer feed changed status. When the sequencer comes back up after an outage, wait for the GRACE_PERIOD_TIME to pass before accepting answers from the data feed. Subtract startedAt from block.timestamp and revert the request if the result is less than the GRACE_PERIOD_TIME.

>The startedAt variable returns 0 only on Arbitrum when the Sequencer Uptime contract is not yet initialized. For L2 chains other than Arbitrum, startedAt is set to block.timestamp on construction and startedAt is never 0. After the feed begins rounds, the startedAt timestamp will always indicate when the sequencer feed last changed status.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The value of `startedAt` should be zero.

### Attack Path

1. Monitor the Chainlink to see if there is a problem with the L2 sequencer's status (network issues or problems with data from oracles)
2. Call `matchOffersV3()` to gain advantage or break the protocol

### Impact

The missing check to confirm the correct status of the `sequencerUptimeFeed` in `DebitaChainlink::checkSequencer()` function will cause `DebitaChainlink::getPrice()` to not revert even when the sequencer uptime feed is not updated or is called in an invalid round.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the missing check for `startedAt` attribute.
