# Insufficient Validation of Chainlink latestRoundData in checkSequencer Function

### Summary

The lack of validation for additional parameters returned by the Chainlink `latestRoundData` function will cause **reliance on stale or invalid sequencer uptime data**, potentially leading to **incorrect assumptions about sequencer status** for **protocol operations**.  


### Root Cause

In `DebitaChainlink.sol:49`, the function `checkSequencer` does not validate critical parameters such as `updatedAt` or `answeredInRound` returned by the `latestRoundData` function.  

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/376fec45be95bd4bbc929fd37b485076b03ab8b0/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L49-L65


Examples:  
- In `DebitaChainlink.sol:49`, the `updatedAt` timestamp is not checked, allowing stale sequencer data to influence the protocol.  
- In `DebitaChainlink.sol:49`, the `answeredInRound` value is not verified against `roundId`, risking reliance on invalid or incomplete round data.  




### Internal pre-conditions

1. A valid `sequencerUptimeFeed` address is set during contract initialization.  
2. The sequencer downtime feed returns data from an oracle (valid or invalid).  


### External pre-conditions

1. The sequencer uptime feed provides stale or invalid data (e.g., `updatedAt` is old, or `answeredInRound` < `roundId`).  

### Attack Path

1. The sequencer uptime feed is set during contract initialization.  
2. The `checkSequencer` function retrieves data from `sequencerUptimeFeed.latestRoundData()`.  
3. The function fails to validate critical parameters and determines an incorrect sequencer status.  

### Impact

The **protocol** suffers an operational failure as incorrect sequencer status assumptions may cause:  
- Pausing of critical operations unnecessarily.  
- Premature resumption of operations during an ongoing grace period.  

### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

1. Validate the `answeredInRound` and `roundId` fields to ensure the data corresponds to a valid round:  
   ```solidity
   require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Invalid round data");
   ```  
2. Validate the `updatedAt` field to ensure the data is not stale:  
   ```solidity
   require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= 1 hours, "Stale sequencer data");
   ```
