# NFT sellers can be tricked into selling for very little or no collateral with tiny `buyRatio` in `buyOrder`

### Summary

Buy orders can be created with an arbitrarily small positive buy ratio. Unfortunate NFT sellers could verify the ratio to be `1` and call `sellNFT` not thinking that it should have decimals.

### Root Cause

No lower limit or "slippage" protection for the `sellNFT()` selling price together with allowing arbitrarily small `buyRatio`:

Until the `amount` is less than `availableAmount` and `availableAmount` is not 0, the function will execute.


### Internal pre-conditions

- NFT seller makes a wrong assumption about `buyRatio` having no decimals when choosing a limit order to sell their NFT

### External pre-conditions

--

### Attack Path

Malicious buyer deliberately creates a limit order with a ratio set to `1`. 


### Impact

The likelihood of a seller's mistake is quite low, but the impact if that happens is very high as the seller loses their NFT with all underlying tokens regardless of their total value.


### PoC

Add the following test case to `BuyOrder.t.sol` test file:
```solidity
    function test_NFTSellerCanGetItAlmostForFree() public {
        address maliciousBuyer = makeAddr("malicious buyer");

         vm.startPrank(maliciousBuyer);
        deal(AERO, maliciousBuyer, 100e18);

        AEROContract.approve(address(factory), 100e18);
        address _buyOrderAddress = factory.createBuyOrder(
            AERO,
            address(receiptContract),
            100e18,
            1
        );
        buyOrderContract = BuyOrder(_buyOrderAddress);

        vm.stopPrank();
        
          vm.startPrank(seller);
        receiptContract.approve(address(buyOrderContract), receiptID);
        buyOrderContract.sellNFT(receiptID);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // seller received just 100 "wei" of AERO.
        assertEq(AEROContract.balanceOf(seller), 100);

    }
```
Run it with:
```shell
 forge test --fork-url https://mainnet.base.org --fork-block-number 21151256  --mt test_NFTSellerCanGetItAlmostForFree  -vvvvv
```

As expected the tx executes successfully, leaving the seller with almost nothing. 

### Mitigation

Add a `minAmount` parameter to `sellNFT()` function to protect the seller from malicious buyers.
