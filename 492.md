# `wantedToken` is stuck in the `BuyOrder` contract without a way to withdraw

### Summary

Users create buy order to buy an NFT `wantedToken` at their desired ratio of the NFT's `lockedAmount`

When a user calls `SellNFT()` to sell the `wantedToken` to the buy order  in exchange for the `buyToken`, the `wantedToken` is trnasfered into the buy order contract.

### Root Cause

The problem is that there is no way for the creator of the buy order to withdraw/use the NFT. hence the NFT is lock in the `BuyOrder` contract without a way to withdraw.

This is possible because the `BuyOrder` contract does not expose a function for the NFT to be transferred or used in any way
