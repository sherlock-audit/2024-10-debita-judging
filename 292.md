# Unauthorized Caller Will Bypass Ownership Update Affecting Contract Control

### Summary

The `changeOwner` function in the smart contract contains a critical flaw that allows any user to call the function without effectively changing the ownership of the contract. This issue arises from a naming conflict between the function parameter and the public variable `owner`, leading to a situation where the intended owner is not updated. This audit identifies the problem and offers recommendations for remediation.


### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Aggregator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682), the function parameter `owner` shadows the public state variable `owner`. As a result, when checking `msg.sender == owner`, it compares `msg.sender` against the parameter instead of the actual state variable, allowing unauthorized callers to bypass ownership updates.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract must have an initialized public variable owner that represents the current owner of the contract.
2. The deployedTime variable must be defined and set at the time of contract deployment.

### External pre-conditions

1. The caller of the function must be an address that is intended to be the new owner.
2. The transaction must occur within 6 hours of contract deployment.

### Attack Path

1. Any user can call `changeOwner` with any address as a parameter.
2. If they are also recognized as `msg.sender`, they will pass the check (`msg.sender == owner`), but since the parameter shadows the state variable, no actual change in ownership occurs.
3. This allows unauthorized users to manipulate contract behavior without updating ownership.

### Impact

The flaw permits unauthorized users to invoke the function without affecting ownership, undermining contract security and control. This can lead to potential exploitation where malicious actors can gain access to sensitive functionalities that should only be available to the legitimate owner.


### PoC

To illustrate this vulnerability, consider the following scenario:
1. Assume `owner` is set to `0x123...abc during deployment.
2. An attacker (e.g., `0x456...def`) calls:

```solidity
changeOwner(0x456...def);
```

3. If `0x456...def` is also recognized as `msg.sender`, they will pass the check, but since `owner` in context refers to the parameter, no actual change occurs.

This means that any user can call this function without changing ownership effectively, leading to potential exploitation.

### Mitigation

To remediate this issue, it is recommended to rename either the function parameter or the public variable so that they do not conflict. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:
```solidity
function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can change ownership");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = newOwner; // Update state variable 'owner' correctly
}
```
