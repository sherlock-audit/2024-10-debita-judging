# Possibility of incomplete loan-borrow cycle when a borrowOffer is cancelled

### Summary

The function `cancelOffer()` in `DBOImplementation` doesnt check for an on-going/incomplete loan cycle before going ahead to cancel the borrowOffer, this will lead to incomplete loan cycle where loans taken won't have been refunded, it only checks if `availableAmount > 0`

### Root Cause

in [cancelOffer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L191), the function only checks that `availableAmount > 0`
