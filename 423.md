# Broken change owner functionality in `Aggregator`, `AuctionFactory`, `BuyOrderFactory` contracts

### Summary

Here's how the change owner [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682) is implemented in these contracts.
```solidity   
 function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```
1)First - because the storage variable owner and the variable in the function is also called owner - the check that msg.sender == owner does not work, because owner is taken from the function parameters.

2)The owner from storage does not change, as owner = owner just writes owner to the function variable.

### Root Cause

Broken change owner functionality

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

There is no attack path as such, it's just that the function is so broken that it doesn't do anything at all, even though it should change the owner

### Impact

There are two consequences to this error.
1) The functionality is incorrectly implemented
2) If it had been implemented correctly, anyone could pass the changeOwner check

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix this function
