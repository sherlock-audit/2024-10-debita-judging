# Ownership cannot be Changed

### Summary

The ``changeOwner function`` contains a logical flaw that prevents the ``owner`` variable from ever being updated. The assignment ``owner = owner`` effectively reassigns the ``owner`` variable to itself, rendering the function non-functional for its intended purpose of changing ownership. 

### Root Cause

The issue lies in the statement:
```solidity
owner = owner;
```
This assignment does not update the ``owner`` variable to the new owner address provided as the function argument. Instead, it redundantly assigns the current value of ``owner`` back to itself, failing to change ownership.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The caller must pass the require check for ``msg.sender == owner``.
2. The function can only be called within 6 hours of the contract’s deployment (``deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp``)

### External pre-conditions

1. A user with the current ``owner`` address must attempt to call the ``changeOwner`` function.
2. The current block timestamp must be within 6 hours of the contract’s deployment.


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Ownership remains locked to the address specified during the contract's deployment.
2. No flexibility to delegate or transfer contract control to another address.

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
@>        owner = owner;
    }

### Mitigation

```solidity
function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
       owner = _owner;
    }
```
