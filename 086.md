# Buyer doesn't receive NFT that they should get in `buyOrder.sellNFT()`

### Summary

Buyer pre-escrows the potential purchase funds of an NFT during [buyOrderFactory.createBuyOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L75-#L124). This creates a `buyOrder.sol` contract for him locally, where an owner of the NFT can potentially accept this buy offer via `sellNFT()`.

When the owner of the NFT accepts the buy offer via `sellNFT()` the NFT mistakenly gets [sent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L101) to the `buyOrder.sol` contract. This contract has no way to send the NFT anywhere, and it should have instead been sent to the buyer of the NFT.
