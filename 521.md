# Aggregator Contract Not Initialized Leads to Loan Process Failure in Borrow and Lend Offer Creation

### Summary

The issue arises in both the `createBorrowOrder` function in `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol` and the `createLendOrder` function in `DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol`, where the `aggregatorContract` is not checked for initialization before being used. If the `aggregatorContract` is uninitialized, new borrow and lend offers will set it to `address(0)`. 

### Root Cause

In the `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol:75`, the `createBorrowOrder` function does not check whether the `aggregatorContract` has been initialized. Therefore, if the `aggregatorContract` has not been initialized and the borrower calls the `createBorrowOrder` function, the newly created `borrowOffer` will set the `aggregatorContract` to `address(0)`. When the `DebitaV3Aggregator` calls the `matchOffersV3` function to accept the borrower's collateral, it will fail because the `acceptBorrowOffer` function in `DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation:137` checks whether the caller is the `aggregatorContract`. Since the `aggregatorContract` is set to `0`, the `matchOffersV3` function will throw an error, and the borrower's collateral will never receive the loan.

The same issue exists in the `createLendOrder` function in `DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol`, where there is no check to ensure that the `aggregatorContract` is initialized.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `aggregatorContract` has not been initialized in `DBOFactory`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

* This issue could raise doubts among users about the reliability of the lending platform. Especially when collateral cannot be recovered, it will severely impact borrowers' trust in the platform.

* Attackers may exploit this vulnerability by maliciously calling `createBorrowOrder` when the `aggregatorContract` is uninitialized, creating a large number of invalid `borrowOffer`s, thus disrupting the normal operation of the system.

* The `DebitaV3Aggregator` will be unable to accept the borrower's collateral when executing the `matchOffersV3` function, causing the entire loan transaction to fail.

### PoC

1.The `aggregatorContract` has not been initialized in `DBOFactory`.

2.An attacker repeatedly calls `createBorrowOrder` to create a large number of `borrowOffer`s with an uninitialized `aggregatorContract`.

3.When the `DebitaV3Aggregator` calls `matchOffersV3` to match loan orders, if it matches one of the maliciously created `borrowOffer`s, it will cause the operation to fail. This disrupts the system's operation and leads to a poor user experience.

```solidity
//caller :attacker
call createBorrowOrder()
//caller :DebitaV3Aggregator
call matchOffersV3 -----------revert()
      ------call acceptBorrowOffer()
                   

```


### Mitigation

In `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory` / `DebitaLendOfferFactory`, the `createBorrowOrder` / `createLendOrder` functions should check whether the `aggregatorContract` has been initialized. Add the following line:

```solidity
require(aggregatorContract != address(0),"AggregatorContract Not Initialized");
```
