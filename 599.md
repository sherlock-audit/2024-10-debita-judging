# Contract change  Ownership  is useless

### Summary

A **critical** self-assignment bug in the `changeOwner()` function causes **permanent ownership lock** for multiple contracts. The `owner` parameter is assigned to itself, making the ownership transfer **ineffective**.

### Root Cause

In multiple contracts, the `changeOwner()` function contains a **self-assignment bug** where `owner = owner` assigns the parameter to itself instead of updating the contract owner:

- In `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol`:
```solidity
// @audit-issue Self-assignment in ownership transfer
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner;  // @audit-issue  Self-assignment bug
}
```

- In `buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol`:
```solidity

function changeOwner(address owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner;  // @audit-issue Self-assignment bug
}
```

- In `auctions/AuctionFactory.sol`:
```solidity
// @audit-issue CRITICAL - Self-assignment in ownership transfer
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner;  // @audit-issue  Self-assignment bug
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

-  The current owner must attempt to transfer ownership

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Owners attempting to delegate control to another entity will unknowingly fail, leaving them locked out of essential functions that rely on ownership. For businesses or projects, this could mean significant operational or financial losses.

### PoC

just copy this function in remix and try to change the owner 
Remix
```solidity
// @audit-issue Self-assignment in ownership transfer
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner;  // @audit-issue Self-assignment bug
}
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
// @audit-fix Corrected ownership transfer implementation
function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
    address currentOwner = owner;  // Cache current owner
    require(msg.sender == currentOwner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    require(newOwner != address(0), "Zero address");
    owner = newOwner;  // @audit-fix Correct assignment
    emit OwnershipTransferred(currentOwner, newOwner);
}
```
