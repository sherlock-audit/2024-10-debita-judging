# Wrong fee calculation in DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan

### Summary

In [`DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547C1-L664C6) function, `misingBorrowFee` will be over calculated because of wrong `feeOfMaxDeadline`

### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan` function, `misingBorrowFee` is the additional amount of fee that the borrower should pay for the additional days of extension of loan to the offer's `maxDeadline`. In the calculation of `feeOfMaxDeadline`, `offer.maxDeadline` is used which is a timestamp (a specific date) in seconds, not the duration in seconds. That is why, `offer.maxDeadline` will always be very high number, forcing the `feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee` in most of the cases even when this should not be. Let's have a look at a possible scenario in below `PoC` section.

```solidity
function extendLoan() public {
    ....
    
               uint misingBorrowFee;

                // if user already paid the max fee, then we dont have to charge them again
                if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
                    // calculate difference from fee paid for the initialDuration vs the extra fee they should pay because of the extras days of extending the loan.  MAXFEE shouldnt be higher than extra fee + PorcentageOfFeePaid
@>                  uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /
                        86400);
                    if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
@>                      feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
                    } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) {
                        feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
                    }

@>                  misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
                }

    ....
}
```

### Impact

Wrong missingBorrowFee charged from the borrower.

### PoC

Assumptions:
- forked mainnet rpc with block height 21151256 --> timestamp 1729091859 (16-Oct-24 15:17:39)
- feePerDay = 4 --> 0.04%
- maxFee = 80 --> 0.8%
- minFee = 20 --> 0.2%

Lend order is created with:
- maxDuration = 1555200 --> 18 days
- minDuration = 86400 --> 1 day

Borrow order is created with:
- duration = 864000 --> 10 days

Connector matches the order on timestamp 1729091859 and the loan is created.

Two days passed, which means that more than 10% time of initial duration has passed, now borrower can extend the loan. Borrower extends the loan. `feeOfMaxDeadline` is calculated as below

```solidity
uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) / 86400);
// feeOfMaxDeadline = (1730647059 * 4) / 86400
// feeOfMaxDeadline = 80122
```
The calculated amount has far exceeded the `maxFee = 80`, so `feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee`.

`misingBorrowFee` is calculated as below
```solidity
misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
// misingBorrowFee = 80 - (4 * 10)
// misingBorrowFee = 40
```
The calculated amount is overstated.

Whereas calculation should be as below

```solidity
uint feeOfMaxDeadline = (((offer.maxDeadline - loanData.startedAt) * feePerDay) / 86400);
// feeOfMaxDeadline = ((1730647059 - 1729091859) * 4) / 86400
// feeOfMaxDeadline = 72
```
Now, the calculated amount is logical and realistic and does not exceed `maxFee = 80` unfairly.

`misingBorrowFee` is should now be calculated as below
```solidity
misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
// misingBorrowFee = 72 - (4 * 10)
// misingBorrowFee = 32
```

### Mitigation

`DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan` function should be modified as below

```diff
function extendLoan() public {
    ....
    
         uint misingBorrowFee;

          // if user already paid the max fee, then we dont have to charge them again
          if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
              // calculate difference from fee paid for the initialDuration vs the extra fee they should pay because of the extras days of extending the loan.  MAXFEE shouldnt be higher than extra fee + PorcentageOfFeePaid
--            uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) / 86400);
++            uint feeOfMaxDeadline = (((offer.maxDeadline - loanData.startedAt) * feePerDay) / 86400);

    ....
}
```
