# FOT properties are not handled by the `TaxTokenReciept` contract

### Summary

The `deposit` function in the `TaxTokensReceipts` contract is designed to accept token deposits and mint an NFT representing the deposited amount. However, the function includes a balance check that fails when Fee-on-Transfer (FOT) tokens are deposited. As a result, any attempt to deposit FOT tokens will cause the function to revert.

### Root Cause

The issue arises from the check in the [`TaxTokenReciept::deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L59) that compares the difference between the contractâ€™s token balance before and after the transfer with the user-specified amount. This logic does not account for the reduced amount received when FOT tokens are used, as a portion of the tokens is taken as a fee by the token contract during the transfer.
```solidity
    function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
      @>require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        //@audit>> this does not support FOT
        tokenID++;
        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
        return tokenID;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `tokenAddress` is a Fee-on-Transfer (FOT) token.


### External pre-conditions

1. The user attempts to deposit a Fee-on-Transfer (FOT) token using the `deposit` function.
2. The token charges a fee during the `safeTransferFrom` call.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The function will always revert when Fee-on-Transfer (FOT) tokens are used. This prevents users from depositing FOT tokens, leading to a poor user experience and making it impossible for users who hold FOT tokens to participate in the protocol via this function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
    function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
-       require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
+       require(difference >= 0, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
-       tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
+       tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = difference;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
-       emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
+       emit Deposited(msg.sender, difference);
        return tokenID;
    }
