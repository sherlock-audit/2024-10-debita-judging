# Lenders and Borrowers that should receive incentives for creating orders that are matched, won't receive incentives in certain cases

### Summary

The ``DebitaIncentives.sol`` contract is used so people can incentivize lenders and borrowers to create loans in specific pairs. When a borrow order and lend orders are matched in the [DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274-L647) function the [DebitaIncentives::updateFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L306-L341) function is called as well, in order to see if the borrow and lenders should be incentivized, and if so updates some parameters based on which later lenders and borrowers can claim their incentives.
```solidity
    function updateFunds(
        infoOfOffers[] memory informationOffers,
        address collateral,
        address[] memory lenders,
        address borrower
    ) public onlyAggregator {
        for (uint i = 0; i < lenders.length; i++) {
            bool validPair = isPairWhitelisted[informationOffers[i].principle][
                collateral
            ];
            if (!validPair) {
                return;
            }
            address principle = informationOffers[i].principle;

            uint _currentEpoch = currentEpoch();

            lentAmountPerUserPerEpoch[lenders[i]][
                hashVariables(principle, _currentEpoch)
            ] += informationOffers[i].principleAmount;
            totalUsedTokenPerEpoch[principle][
                _currentEpoch
            ] += informationOffers[i].principleAmount;
            borrowAmountPerEpoch[borrower][
                hashVariables(principle, _currentEpoch)
            ] += informationOffers[i].principleAmount;

            emit UpdatedFunds(
                lenders[i],
                principle,
                collateral,
                borrower,
                _currentEpoch
            );
        }
    }
``` 
As can be seen from the above code snippet, the function first checks whether the pair is whitelisted. But if the pair is not whitelisted it directly exits the loop and returns the execution back to the [DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274-L647) function. This is problematic because creating borrow and lend order is permissionless and so is matching them, users may create loans for different token pairs, and if they use ratios they don't even have to rely on a data feed being whitelisted for a specific asset. Some borrowers may decide to accept USDT, USDC but some stranger token as well, which hasn't been whitelisted in the ``DebitaIncentives.sol`` contract. It is true that such offers shouldn't be incetivized, however the problem is that such an offer may precede other offers that should be incentivezd, but given the fact that the function uses return instead of continue this will be problematic. If an offer with a principle and collateral that are not whitelisted is the first offer, and then there are 28 more offers that are whitelisted and there are incentives for them in the current epoch, they won't receive any incentives. The [DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274-L647) function can be called by anyone, and he can order the offers in any way he sees fit, users that call this function also receive a fee for matching orders. A malicious actor can order the offers in such a way that a not whitelisted pair is first,  so the next offers won't receive any rewards. This will result in the lender and borrower loosing their rewards, based on the incentives and the amount of the loan this may result in a big loss. 

### Root Cause

In  the [DebitaIncentives::updateFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L306-L341) function a return is used if a pair is not valid, instead of continue, this way not all offers will be checked if they should be incentivized.

### Impact

Due to a return being used in the [DebitaIncentives::updateFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L306-L341) function, if a non whitelisted offer precedes other offers that are whitelisted and the borrower and lenders of those offers should receive rewards for the current epoch, they won't. Based on the amount of the principle in the offer and the incentives for the whitelisted pair for the current epoch those loses may be significant.
