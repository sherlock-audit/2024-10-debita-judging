# FoT tokens are incompatible with the TaxTokensReceipt contract

### Summary

In order to use Fee-On-Transfer tokens to interact with the protocol users must first deposit them into the `TaxTokensReceipt` contract, which will mint the users a tax token receipt NFT representing the collateral. However the current design doesn't allow the integration of FoT with the protocol.

### Root Cause

If we take a look at the `TaxTokenReceipt::deposit()` function: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/ce50bab1067574ae493f4062665b8e28611f2346/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L69

```javascript
// expect that owners of the token will excempt from tax this contract
    function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
@>      require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
        return tokenID;
    }
```

We can see that the transfered amount after tax is required to be greater or equal to the initial amount (before tax), this will cause permanent DoS to users

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

Consider the following scenario:

1. User tries to deposit `1000` FoT (let's say it has `10` fee)
2. `balanceBefore` = `0`
3. `balanceAfter` = `990`
4. `difference` = `990 - 0` = `990`
5. `require(990 >= 1000)` it will revert on this line

### Mitigation

Remove the `require` statement line
