# Ownership transfer functionality is entirely broken in `changeOwner` Function

## Summary

In the `AuctionFactory` contract, the `changeOwner` function is intended to allow the contract owner to transfer ownership within the first 6 hours of contract deployment. However, a variable shadowing issue prevents the function from updating the state variable `owner`. This creates a critical functional flaw, leaving the owner state variable unchanged despite the function's invocation, and renders ownership transfer impossible.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `AuctionFactory` contract defines a state variable `owner` that stores the address of the contract's owner. This variable is initialized to the deployer's address in the constructor:
```js
address owner; // owner of the contract
constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
    feeAddress = msg.sender;
    deployedTime = block.timestamp;
}
```
The [changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218-L222) function is designed to enable the current owner to update the `owner` state variable to a new owner within a time window of 6 hours after deployment. However, the function's implementation contains a shadowing issue:
```js
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner; //@audit 
}
```
The `owner` parameter in the function signature shadows the state variable `owner`. As a result:
1. The `require(msg.sender == owner)` condition checks against the function's parameter `owner` instead of the state variable, allowing anyone to bypass this check.
2. The statement `owner = owner;` assigns the parameter `owner` to itself, leaving the state variable unchanged.

As a result, the `owner` state variable remains unchanged regardless of the input or logic.

This issue is also present in the [buyOrderFactory](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186-L190) contract and [debitaV3Aggregrator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682-L686) contract.

## Impact

Ownership transfer functionality is entirely broken as the `changeOwner` function does not update the `owner` state variable.

## Recommendation

To fix this issue:

Rename the parameter in the `changeOwner` function to avoid shadowing the state variable.
Correctly update the `owner` state variable.
```js
function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = newOwner; 
}
```
