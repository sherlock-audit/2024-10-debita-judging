# Interest paid for non perpetual loan during loan extension is lost when the borrower repays debt

### Summary

When a borrower call `extendLoan()`to extend a loan to the max deadline, interest is accrued to the lender up until the time the loan is extended and the lender's `interestPaid` is updated as well for accounting purpose when calculating the interest with `calculateInterestToPay()`

### Root Cause

As shown below interest is accrued and `interestPaid` is also accrued correctly
```solidity

File: DebitaV3Loan.sol
655:                 } else {
656:      @>             loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestToClaim +=
657:                         interestOfUsedTime - 
658:                         interestToPayToDebita;
659:                 }
660:                 loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestPaid += interestOfUsedTime;

```

The problem is that when a borrower extends a loan and later repays the loan a the end of the `maxDeadline` that the loan was extended to, the unpaid interest is used to **overwrite the previously accrued interest** (as shown on L238 below) thus leading to a loss of interest to the borrower

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Loan.sol
186:     function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
187:         IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);
////SNIP   .......
237:             } else {
238:     @>            loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim =
239:                     interest -
240:                     feeOnInterest;
241:             }

```
