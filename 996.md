# Lenders cannot liquidate/claimCollateral when collateral value is on rapid decline

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L353-L356

The only option for Lenders to claim collateral which requires deadline to have passed

```solidity
 function claimCollateralAsLender(uint index) external nonReentrant {
        LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
        infoOfOffers memory offer = m_loan._acceptedOffers[index];
        IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);
        require(
            ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) == msg.sender,
            "Not lender"
        );
        // burn ownership
        ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID);
        uint _nextDeadline = nextDeadline();

        require(offer.paid == false, "Already paid");
        require(
            _nextDeadline < block.timestamp && _nextDeadline != 0,
            "Deadline not passed"
        );
```

The problem with this is that Lenders cannot claim collateral when collateral value is going down below the CURRENT VALUE of the original ratio.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

No support to maintain correct ration in Loan contract, so value of collateral can fall greatly below the original ratio even to the point where borrower has no need to payBack loan and leaves lender with bad debt

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Valuation drop of Collateral token

### Impact

Lender is left to lose value, even when loan expires and ```claimCollateralAsLender()``` is called, Lender will not get collateral that is even worth the value of the principle amount.

### PoC

1. For ration 0.5e18 for instance 
2. Principle is 1500e18 DAI
3. Collateral is 1WETH worth 3000_DAI at the point of matching
4. The loan duration is 1_year!
5. few months later, WETH value droping below $1,500(realistic!)
6. Lender cannot still claim collateral
7. Big question: Why should Borrower repay(with interes)?
8. By the time the duration is over WETH value is below 1,500_DAI(loss to Lender)


It is worth to note that EVERY LENDER will set maxRatio based on CURRENT MARKET VALUE of principle

### Mitigation

Include a verified/whitelisted oracle that can help to track/monitor the correct ration in a loan and allow claiming of collateral when current ratio(current value based) is above the tolerable limit of the lendOffer
