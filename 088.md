https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L145

  function _deleteAuctionOrder(address _AuctionOrder) external onlyAuctions {
        // get index of the Auction order
        uint index = AuctionOrderIndex[_AuctionOrder];
        AuctionOrderIndex[_AuctionOrder] = 0;

        // get last Auction order
        allActiveAuctionOrders[index] = allActiveAuctionOrders[
            activeOrdersCount - 1
        ];
        // take out last Auction order
        allActiveAuctionOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

        // switch index of the last Auction order to the deleted Auction order
        AuctionOrderIndex[allActiveAuctionOrders[index]] = index;
        activeOrdersCount--;
    }
