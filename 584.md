# Owner of DebitaV3Aggregator contract cannot change owner due to shadowing

### Summary

Shadowing situation in [DebitaV3Aggregator::changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682-L686), in which the input argument function has the same name as the state variable, will prevent the owner of DebitaV3Aggregator from changing to a new owner, regardless if the [timing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L684) condition is met.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Aggregator::changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682-L686), the input argument to the changeOwner function is called owner, the same as the corresponding state variable, making the assignment of the new owner [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L685) to disregard the input argument provided.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Owner of DebitaV3Aggregator needs to call changeOwner.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Owner of DebitaV3Aggregator needs to call changeOwner and it does not matter what input address they will provide.

### Impact

Owner of DebitaV3Aggregator cannot change to a different owner for the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the input argument name to something else such as _newOwner_ and change [this line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L685) to:
```solidity
owner = newOwner
```
