# Ownerships token transferees cannot claim incentives

### Summary

The design choice to bind incentives to original borrower/lender addresses rather than token ownership will cause a loss of incentive rewards for token transferees as new token holders cannot claim incentives associated with their acquired ownership.

### Root Cause

It lacks the transferability of incentive rights when lending/borrowing positions change hands.
In DebitaIncentives.sol, incentives are tracked using address-based mappings:

```solidity
// principle => (keccack256(bribe token, epoch)) => total incentives amount
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => uint))
        public lentIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch;

    // wallet address => keccack256(principle + epoch) => amount lent
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => uint))
        public lentAmountPerUserPerEpoch;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User A borrows/lends and accumulates incentive rights
2. User A transfers their ownership token to User B
3. User B cannot claim incentives despite owning the ownership  because rewards are still mapped to User A's address
4. User A can still claim incentives despite no longer holding the ownership

### Impact

The ownership token transferees cannot claim  incentives associated with their acquired ownership

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement incentive rights transfer function or switch to ownership token-based incentive tracking
