# Ownership Management Broken by Variable Name Conflict

### Summary

The `changeOwner` functions in `AuctionFactory.sol` and `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol` are using the same name of `owner` variable and state variable results in a self-referential assignment that fails to update ownership.

### Root Cause

In `changeOwner` function, using the same name owner for both parameter and state variable results in a self-referential assignment that fails to update ownership.

Code:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Current owner initiates ownership transfer (msg.sender == owner)
2. Transfer attempt must occur in deployment window (deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp)

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Owner attempts ownership transfer via `changeOwner`
2. Permission checks succeed
3. Variable shadowing causes parameter to update itself
4. Contract ownership remains with original owner
5. No error message indicates transfer failure

### Impact

Critical ownership functionality is compromised:

1. Ownership cannot be transferred during crucial initial period
2. First owner becomes permanent by default
3. Emergency ownership transfers blocked during setup phase

### PoC

I made a basic contract with exactly the same owner functionality to demonstrate the bug:

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.0;

contract TestOwnerOverwrite {
    address owner;

    uint256 deployedTime;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        deployedTime = block.timestamp;
    }

    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }

    function getOwner() public view returns (address) {
        return owner;
    }
}
```

Here is the test to see the bug:

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.0;

import {console, Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {TestOwnerOverwrite} from "./Owner.sol";

contract OwnerTest is Test {
    TestOwnerOverwrite ownerContract;
    address owner = makeAddr("owner");
    address newOwner = makeAddr("newOwner");

    function setUp() public {
        vm.prank(owner);
        ownerContract = new TestOwnerOverwrite();
    }

    function testOwershipTransferDoesNotSucced() public {
        assert(ownerContract.getOwner() == owner);

        vm.prank(owner);
        vm.expectRevert();
        ownerContract.changeOwner(newOwner);

        address newExpectedOwner = ownerContract.getOwner();
        assert(newExpectedOwner != newOwner);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Resolve naming conflict by using distinct parameter name:

```solidity
function changeOwner(address newAddress) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = newAddress;
    }
```
