# Improper Initialization Call in DBOFactory::createBorrowOrder()

### Summary

The createBorrowOrder() function within the DBOFactory contract calls the initialize function directly on the implementation contract, rather than through the proxy. This introduces significant functionality, security, and operational issues that compromise the design and usability of the protocol.



### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue lies in the improper invocation of the initialize function. Instead of invoking it through the proxy contract, the implementation contract itself directly executes the call. In proxy-based architectures, the initialize function should always be executed through the proxy to properly set up storage variables and states within the proxy contract, not the implementation contract.

### Impact

Any state variables set during initialization are stored in the implementation contract rather than the proxy. This causes a mismatch, as the proxy contract's state (where interactions are expected to occur) remains uninitialized.

### Mitigation

The purpose of having an `initialize` function in an implementation contract is to set the proxy's state after deployment. Below is the recommended approach that correctly utilizes the proxy to invoke the `initialize` function:


```solidity
function createBorrowOrder(
        bool[] memory _oraclesActivated,
        uint[] memory _LTVs,
        uint _maxInterestRate,
        uint _duration,
        address[] memory _acceptedPrinciples,
        address _collateral,
        bool _isNFT,
        uint _receiptID,
        address[] memory _oracleIDS_Principles,
        uint[] memory _ratio,
        address _oracleID_Collateral,
        uint _collateralAmount
    ) external returns (address) {
        if (_isNFT) {
            require(_receiptID != 0, "Receipt ID cannot be 0");
            require(_collateralAmount == 1, "Started Borrow Amount must be 1");
        }

        require(_LTVs.length == _acceptedPrinciples.length, "Invalid LTVs");
        require(
            _oracleIDS_Principles.length == _acceptedPrinciples.length,
            "Invalid length"
        );
        require(
            _oraclesActivated.length == _acceptedPrinciples.length,
            "Invalid oracles"
        );
        require(_ratio.length == _acceptedPrinciples.length, "Invalid ratio");
        require(_collateralAmount > 0, "Invalid started amount");
        //@audit =====> 
        DebitaProxyContract proxy = new DebitaProxyContract(
            implementationContract
        );
        DBOImplementation createdBorrowOrder = DBOImplementation(address(proxy));

        createdBorrowOrder.initialize(
            aggregatorContract,
            msg.sender,
            _acceptedPrinciples,

            _receiptID,
            _oracleIDS_Principles,
            _ratio,
            _oracleID_Collateral,
            _collateralAmount
        );
        isBorrowOrderLegit[address(borrowOffer)] = true;
        if (_isNFT) {
            IERC721(_collateral).transferFrom( 
                msg.sender,
                address(borrowOffer),
                _receiptID
            );
        } else {
            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                IERC20(_collateral),
                msg.sender,
                address(borrowOffer),
                _collateralAmount
            );
        }
        borrowOrderIndex[address(borrowOffer)] = activeOrdersCount;
        allActiveBorrowOrders[activeOrdersCount] = address(borrowOffer);
        activeOrdersCount++;

        uint balance = IERC20(_collateral).balanceOf(address(borrowOffer));
        require(balance >= _collateralAmount, "Invalid balance");

        emit BorrowOrderCreated(
            address(borrowOffer),
            msg.sender,
            _maxInterestRate,
            _duration,
            _LTVs,
            _ratio,
            _collateralAmount,
            true
        );
        return address(borrowOffer);
