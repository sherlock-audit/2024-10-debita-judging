# [H-1]:  `claimIncentives` function is vulnerable to DoS attack due to unbounded `principles` and `tokensIncentives` lengths

### Summary

In [DataInsentives.sol:142](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol??plain=1#L142) the `claimIncentives` function has nested `for` loops on unbounded `principles` and `tokensIncentives` lengths as a malicious user could use those two function parameters and pass them with sufficiently big lengths causing many iterations resulting in a DoS attack by exceeding the block gas limit, preventing users from claiming their incentives.

### Root Cause

- In [DataInsentives.sol:142](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol??plain=1#L142) the `claimIncentives` function receives two parameters: an array `address[] memory principles` and a matrix `address[][] memory tokensIncentives` with no limitation to the size.
- The first `for` loop iterates over `principles.length` and the nested second one over `tokensIncentives[i].length`. Which results in a complexity of M * N (M being `principles.length` and N being `tokensIncentives[i].length`) since neither `principles` nor the `tokensIncentives` are bounded in any way. This could cause an excessive gas consumption rendering the `claimIncentives` functionality unusable.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- A malicious user could pass as parameters very big in length `principles` and `tokensIncentives` where the gas cost required to execute the function exceeds the block gas limit resulting in the transaction failing, effectively causing a DoS and shutting down the claim incentives functionality.


- A regular user with big enough in length `principles` and/or `tokensIncentives` could call `claimIncentives`. The bigger the provided parameters are, the more gas is going to cost, potentially resulting in the user not being able to claim their incentives due to a reverted transaction.

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user calls `claimIncentives` with very large array (`principles`) and matrix (`tokensIncentives`) for the appropriate epoch.

### Impact

The current iterations over the lengths could cause the contract to perform poorly under heavy load. 

A potential DoS attack on the  `claimIncentives` function would lock the users out of receiving their incentives for the appropriate epoch.

### PoC

The following test shows how the gas consumption grows with the size of the arrays:

        );
        uint gasCostSecond = gasStartSecond - gasleft();

        // Example costs:
        // gasCostFirst =   115480
        // gasCostSecond = 1159196
        console.log(gasCostFirst, gasCostSecond);

        assert(gasCostSecond > gasCostFirst);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

- Process the incentives in smaller batches.
- Modify the  `claimIncentives` logic to avoid loops all together.
