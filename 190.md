# Missing `__gap` in upgradeable contract can cause storage collision in future upgrades.

### Summary

The absence of a `__gap` in the contract `BuyOrder` will cause **storage collision** for future upgrades, impacting **the proxy contract's storage layout**. This occurs as the **added state variables during upgrades** will overwrite existing proxy storage, leading to unpredictable behavior.

### Root Cause

In the following code:
- `BuyOrder.sol`, there is no reserved storage gap (`__gap`) to prevent future storage collisions in proxy-based upgradeable contracts.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract `BuyOrder` must be deployed as an upgradeable contract using a proxy.
2. A future implementation upgrade must introduce new state variables.


### External pre-conditions

1. A proxy contract must be used to delegate calls to the `BuyOrder` logic contract.


### Attack Path

1. The contract `BuyOrder` is deployed as an upgradeable contract via a proxy.
2. A new implementation is introduced during an upgrade that adds state variables to the `BuyOrder` contract.
3. The new variables overwrite critical proxy storage slots (e.g., `admin` or `implementation` address), leading to broken functionality.


### Impact

The **protocol suffers an unpredictable behavior** as the proxy storage layout is corrupted. 
- **Admin-controlled operations** may fail or behave incorrectly.
- The **entire protocol functionality** could break, depending on the overwritten data.


### PoC

```solidity
// Example of adding a new variable in a future upgrade:
contract BuyOrderV2 is BuyOrder {
    uint256 public newVariable; // This overwrites existing proxy storage.

    function newFunction() external {
        newVariable = 42; // Proxy storage corruption occurs here.
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
contract BuyOrder is Initializable {
    uint256[50] private __gap; // Reserve storage slots for future upgrades.
}
```
