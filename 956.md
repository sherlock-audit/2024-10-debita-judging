# If no one will lend a principle in epoch, then incentivise for it will be stuck on the contract

### Summary

Let's take a look at the contract 
[`DebitaIncentivize`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L5).

This contract allows anyone to reward the use of certain tokens as principle in a particular epoch.
However, the contract does not provide for the case where the principle is not used at all in a given epoch - in which case the rewards that were sent for that pair (principle, epoch) will simply be stuck on the contract.

Let's take a look at how the distribution of incenties goes. It takes place in the `claimIncentives` function

```solidity
    function claimIncentives(
        address[] memory principles,
        address[][] memory tokensIncentives,
        uint epoch
    ) public {
        // get information
        require(epoch < currentEpoch(), "Epoch not finished");

        for (uint i; i < principles.length; i++) {
            address principle = principles[i];
            uint lentAmount = lentAmountPerUserPerEpoch[msg.sender][
                hashVariables(principle, epoch)
            ];
            // get the total lent amount for the epoch and principle
            uint totalLentAmount = totalUsedTokenPerEpoch[principle][epoch];

            uint porcentageLent;

            if (lentAmount > 0) {
                porcentageLent = (lentAmount * 10000) / totalLentAmount;
            }

            uint borrowAmount = borrowAmountPerEpoch[msg.sender][
                hashVariables(principle, epoch)
            ];
            uint totalBorrowAmount = totalUsedTokenPerEpoch[principle][epoch];
            uint porcentageBorrow;

            require(
                borrowAmount > 0 || lentAmount > 0,
                "No borrowed or lent amount"
            );

            porcentageBorrow = (borrowAmount * 10000) / totalBorrowAmount;

            for (uint j = 0; j < tokensIncentives[i].length; j++) {
                address token = tokensIncentives[i][j];
                uint lentIncentive = lentIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch[principle][
                    hashVariables(token, epoch)
                ];
                uint borrowIncentive = borrowedIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch[
                    principle
                ][hashVariables(token, epoch)];
                require(
                    !claimedIncentives[msg.sender][
                        hashVariablesT(principle, epoch, token)
                    ],
                    "Already claimed"
                );
                require(
                    (lentIncentive > 0 && lentAmount > 0) ||
                        (borrowIncentive > 0 && borrowAmount > 0),
                    "No incentives to claim"
                );
                claimedIncentives[msg.sender][
                    hashVariablesT(principle, epoch, token)
                ] = true;

                uint amountToClaim = (lentIncentive * porcentageLent) / 10000;
                amountToClaim += (borrowIncentive * porcentageBorrow) / 10000;

                IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amountToClaim);

                emit ClaimedIncentives(
                    msg.sender,
                    principle,
                    token,
                    amountToClaim,
                    epoch
                );
            }
        }
    }
```

If lentAmount for each user is 0 (like totalLentAmount, like borrowAmount ) - then the function will not execute because of require
```solidity
require(
                borrowAmount > 0 || lentAmount > 0,
                ‘No borrowed or lent amount’
            );
```
If there are no loans from principle in a given era, no one will be able to take the rewards. 
Fields that will remain 0 are changed only when calling the `updateFunds` function that is called at `matchedOffersV3` - that is, if there will never be any offer matched in epoch, then all fields will stay zero

### Root Cause

There is no provision for edge case when there were no loans at all in epoch

### Internal pre-conditions

Somebody's taking over future epoch for any principle token
No-one incentivize this principle in this epoch

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The probability that no one will make a loan in a particular era with a given principle is low.

However, impact is high, stuck tokens.

Severity medium

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a mechanism where rewarder can withdraw funds after an epoch has passed and there are no loans with that principle.
