The following is the extract from the [contest's README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3-xiaoming9090?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate):

> Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?
> - Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in TaxTokensReceipt contract

Thus, Fee-on-Transfer (FOT) tokens are supported within the protocol as long as it is wrapped within the `TaxTokensReceipt contract`.

Assume that the FOT has a 10% transfer tax. Thus, if one transfers 100 FOT, the issuer will collect 10 FOT, and the recipient will receive 90 FOT.

Assume that Bob will create a borrow or lender offer using 100 FOT. In this case, he will call `TaxTokensReceipt.deposit(100 FOT)`.

The `balanceBefore` at Line 60 is zero at this point. Next, Line 61 below will attempt to pull 100 FOT from Bob's wallet. However, due to the 10% transfer tax, only 90 FOT will be transferred to the `TaxTokensReceipt` contract. Thus, the `difference` at Line 68 will be 90 FOT.

Next, the `require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");` check will be executed. Since `difference` will always be lesser than `amount` due to the tax, this `require` statement will always revert. As a result, there is no way for anyone to wrap their FOT within the `TaxTokensReceipt` to be used within the protocol.

```solidity
File: TaxTokensReceipt.sol
58:     // expect that owners of the token will excempt from tax this contract
59:     function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
60:         uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
61:         SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
62:             ERC20(tokenAddress),
63:             msg.sender,
64:             address(this),
65:             amount
66:         );
67:         uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
68:         uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
69:         require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
70:         tokenID++;
71:         tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
72:         _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
73:         emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
74:         return tokenID;
75:     }
```

### Impact

Medium. It meets the following requirements of Medium severity.

- Breaks core contract functionality since the protocol is designed to support FOT by wrapping it within the `TaxTokensReceipt`. However, due to this bug, FOT cannot be used within the protocol.
- Rendering the contract useless. The `TaxTokensReceipt` is effectively useless since no one can deposit FOT token.
