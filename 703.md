# extendLoan will always charge the max fees for the borrower

### Summary

A computation is wrong in the extendLoan function of the DebitaV3Loan the consequence of that is that the function will charge the max fees for the borrower every time even when it should not.

### Root Cause

consider this bloc of code where the PorcentageOfFeePaid represent the amount of fees that the borrower paid when the loan was created :

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L600-L611

the else if block is unreachable because this variable will always be higher than the fees the user paid : 

```solidity 
uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) / 
         86400); 
```
It's because the maxdeadline represent a timestamp eqal to the start time of the loan plus the maxDuration of the lendOrder
as we can see in this line of code : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L511
In conclusion the protocol compute the fees of the max delay wrongly since the result of this computation is fees for all the timestamp of the maxDelay.

### Internal pre-conditions

none.

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. The borrower call extendLoan 


### Impact

The use will always pay the maxfees for the loan even when he sould not.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the operation like that to correspond to the extra days of the offer : 

```solidity 
 uint feeOfMaxDeadline = (((offer.maxDeadline- m_loan.startedAt) * feePerDay) /
                        86400);
```
