# Lack of Checks for Decimals from Chainlink Oracle in `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3`

### Summary

There is a missing check on the number of decimals in the [`DebitaChainlink::getThePrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L30) function. Orders can be initialized to use the Chainlink oracle to get prices for [`priceCollateral_BorrowOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L309), and [`pricePrinciple`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L334) in the `matchOffersV3` function. If the oracle returns prices with different decimals, it will cause the ratio to be calculated wrong. It will result in the function either reverting, or at the worst matching the wrong borrow and lend offers. 

**Note: The same vulnerability is also present in the [lend order](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L440) but this report will only go through the borrow order's part of the `matchOffersV3` function because the formula is almost the same when calculating the ratio, and it shares the same root cause.**

### Root Cause

Since there is no checks for the decimals of the returned price from the Chainlink oracle, and the outputs are directly used in the following [calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L350): 

$$ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = \frac{priceCollateral\\_BorrowOrder \times 10^8}{pricePrinciple}$$

$$value = \frac{(ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral \times borrowInfo.LTVs[indexForPrinciple\\_BorrowOrder[i]])}{10000}$$

```solidity
uint principleDecimals = ERC20(principles[i]).decimals()
```
This principles is different than the principles price returned by the oracle. 

$$ratio = \frac{value \times (10^{principleDecimals})}{10^8}$$

There are many pairs in the Chainlink Oracle like `eth/usd` that returns a value with `8` decimals, and `usdc/eth` or `ampl/usd` that returns a value with `18` decimals. `ampl` is an ERC-20 token, which this protocol should be able to support based on the README. 

Here are the possible scenarios that will follow: 

### 1. Collateral Price has `8` decimals and Principle Price has `18` decimals: 
When dividing in the first equation `Collateral * 10**8 / Principle` will result in the following math: 

$$\frac{x \times 10^8 \times 10^7}{y \times 10^{18}} = \frac{x \times 10^{15}}{y \times 10^{18}}$$

In all cases where the Collateral Price is less than `1000`, solidity will give an answer of `0`. 

### 2. Collateral Price has `18` decimals and Principle Price has `8` decimals: 
When dividing in the first equation `Collateral * 10**8 / Principle` will result in the following math: 

$$\frac{x \times 10^{18} \times 10^7}{y \times 10^8} = \frac{x \times 10^{25}}{y \times 10^8}$$

This will result in a huge ratio. 

### 3. Both Collateral Price and Principle Price has the same number of decimals
This will not cause any issues and this is probably how the function is supposed to run. 

Scenarios 1 & 2 will always give the wrong ratio. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to create a Borrow Order or Lend Order with the Chainlink Oracle's price feed. 
2. The Chainlink Oracle needs to output the price feed with different decimals for a principle, and a collateral. 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Fulfilling the pre-conditions, this will cause the ratio of a pair of collateral and principle to **ALWAYS** return the wrong ratio. With the wrong ratio, it might revert, or it might match orders incorrectly or not optimally.

Attackers can always reverse-engineer the math and put in a lend offer or borrow offer that will be highly favorable to them, and result in loss of funds for the users. 

The fact that fulfilling the pre-conditions are in the hands of the attacker, and that Chainlink might be the oracle of choice for a majority of the users, this vulnerability will cause loopholes for attackers to open attractive lend/borrow offers that cause loss of funds for honest users. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider writing a function that will normalize all the Chainlink Oracle's output to a standard decimal count of your choice.
