# The changeOwner() function used across several contracts won't change the owner

### Summary

The current implementation of _changeOwner()_ fails to achieve the intended functionality due to variable shadowing, which causes the ownership state variable to remain unchanged.

This renders the function ineffective, leading to disrupted governance.

### Root Cause

The _changeOwner()_ function has been implemented in several contracts with the intention to allow the current owner to assign a new one within 6 hours of the contract creation:
- [DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:682](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682)
- [AuctionFactory.sol:218](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218)
- [buyOrderFactory.sol:186](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186)

However there is a issue with an incorrect naming and usage of the local variable _owner_ as it shadows the contract's state variable, which is named in the same way. 

When the function attempts to assign the input value of _owner_ to the state variable it only updates the local variable which is discarded at the end, leaving the state variable unchanged.

### Impact

- Ownership remains unchanged - This defeats the main purpose of the function.
- Misleading behavior - The function does not fail or revert, leaving the sense that the _owner_ has been changed while he remains the same.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The local and storage variable names should be different to prevent variable shadowing:
```diff
-    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
+    function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
-       owner = owner;
+       owner = _owner;
    }
```
