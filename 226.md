# Loan extension miscalculation will cause reversion of extendLoan

### Summary

An incorrect calculation of `extendedTime` in the `extendLoan` function will cause unnecessary `extendLoan` reversion for borrowers as the function reverts when attempting to extend the loan due to invalid logic.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan.sol:590`, the unnecessary subtraction of `alreadyUsedTime` from `offer.maxDeadline` causes a miscalculation of `extendedTime`, leading to invalid logic and transaction reversion.

```solidity
uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;
uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline -
    alreadyUsedTime -
    block.timestamp;
```
If `alreadyUsedTime` is greater than `offer.maxDeadline - block.timestamp` (`RealExtendedTime`), it reverts.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

`alreadyUsedTime` is greater than `offer.maxDeadline - block.timestamp`.

### Attack Path

1. Borrower attempts to call the `extendLoan()` function to extend the loan duration.  
2. The function checks and passes initial conditions:
   - `loanData.extended` is `false`.  
   - The current `block.timestamp` is less than the `nextDeadline()` value.  
   - The borrower satisfies ownership requirements and loan duration conditions.  
3. During execution, the `extendedTime` calculation in `extendLoan()` subtracts `alreadyUsedTime` from `offer.maxDeadline`, resulting in a negative or invalid value.  
4. The miscalculated `extendedTime` causes the function to revert, preventing the borrower from extending their loan.  
5. This leads to the `extendLoan` reversion unnecessarily, allowing lenders to claim the collateral, even though the borrower intended to repay.  

### Impact

Borrowers will face unnecessary loan defaults due to the inability to extend their loans, even when eligible. This leads to premature liquidation of their collateral, causing financial loss to borrowers and potential disputes in the platform's operation. Additionally, the platform may suffer reputational damage as users lose trust in its reliability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - block.timestamp;
require(extendedTime > 0, "Invalid extension period");
```
