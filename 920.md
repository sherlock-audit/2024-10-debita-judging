# insufficient input validation allows other lend order in `DLOFactory` to be deleted

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207-L220

The deleteOrder function in the DLOFactory contract lacks input validation to ensure the deleted order has not already been removed. While this issue does not manifest in other factory contracts where the delete function is restricted to a single call, it becomes a significant vulnerability in conjunction with the DLOImplementation contract.

In DLOImplementation, users can repeatedly invoke addFunds and cancelOffer, which indirectly triggers the deletion of orders in the factory. This allows malicious or unintended repeated deletions, potentially disrupting the integrity of the factory's state.

### Root Cause

there is no check if an order is already deleted in the factory delete function

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. bob creates a lend offer
2. bob cancels the offer
3. bob adds funds to the offer
4. bob repeats 2 and 3
5. bob ends up deleting other lend offers from the factory

### Impact

the record of created offers in the factory is not correct

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

only delete from the factory if an offer is not in the record
