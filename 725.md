# Missing Chainlink stale price check with heartbeat mechanism

### Summary

The missing check of stale price in Chainlink price oracle can potentially cause ptotocol broken.

### Root Cause

The protocol uses chainlink price feed as oracle to provide price query online. Inside the DebitaChainlink::getThePrice function, the priceFeed get price using priceFeed.latestRoundData() method. The function checks the sequencer up/down state and put a constraint on layer2 startup grace period with GRACE_PERIOD_TIME variable.  However, chainklink itself uses heartbeat machinism to feed the priceFeed contract. For example, price feed updates on 0.5% change of price, if there is no change for a period(1hour or so), the price feed updates again - this is called heartbeat. 
In light of above, it is recommaned to include a stale price check on price fetching.

### Mitigation

consider making following changes:
```diff
function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
...
-    (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
+    (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
    require(price > 0, 'Invalid price');
+    require(block.timestamp <= updatedAt + HEARTBEAT_TIME, 'Stale Price');
    return price;
}
```
