# DOS : AcceptBorrowOffer Will Cause NFT Transfer Failures for Borrowers in DebitaV3Aggregator Contract

### Summary

This report highlights a significant issue related to the `acceptBorrowOffer` function in the `DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol` contract, which is called by the `DebitaV3Aggregator` contract. The inability of the `DebitaV3Aggregator` to properly handle `ERC721` token transfers can result in transaction failures for borrowers attempting to use NFTs as collateral during the borrowing process. This oversight may lead to a denial of service for users relying on NFTs for their borrowing needs.


### Root Cause

In [DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L151), the `acceptBorrowOffer` function calls `nft.transferFrom`, but the `DebitaV3Aggregator` contract does not implement the `IERC721Receiver` interface. This omission prevents the aggregator from safely receiving ERC721 tokens, leading to transaction failures when an NFT is transferred as collateral.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `matchOffersV3` function has been called, leading to a subsequent call to the `acceptBorrowOffer` function.

2. The `m_borrowInformation.isNFT` condition evaluates to true, indicating that an NFT is being used as collateral.

3. The collateral address in `m_borrowInformation` points to a valid ERC721 token contract.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user attempts to execute the `acceptBorrowOffer` function, which is invoked by the `matchOffersV3` function in the `DebitaV3Aggregator`.
2. The transaction calls the `transferFrom` method on the `ERC721` token, targeting the aggregatorContract.
3. Since `DebitaV3Aggregator` does not implement `IERC721Receiver`, the call fails, causing a revert in the transaction.
4. This failure prevents borrowers from successfully using their NFTs as collateral, resulting in a denial of service.

### Impact

The lack of proper handling for ERC721 tokens can lead to:

- Transaction Failures: Borrowers may experience failed transactions when attempting to use NFTs as collateral.
- Loss of User Trust: Continuous issues with NFT transfers can erode trust in the platform and its functionality.
- Operational Inefficiencies: Users may be unable to complete necessary actions, impacting overall platform usability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Modify Contract: Update the `DebitaV3Aggregator` contract to inherit from `IERC721Receiver`.
2. Implement Required Function: Add the implementation of `onERC721Received`, ensuring it returns the correct value:
