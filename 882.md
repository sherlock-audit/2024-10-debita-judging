# Users are unable to receive incentive rewards

### Summary

When the epoch is set to 1, calling incentivizePair will cause a revert, preventing the first users to borrow or lend from receiving rewards

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is that `currentEpoch` has a minimum value of 1, while the epoch value passed when calling `incentivizePair` must be greater than 1. As a result, the first users to borrow or lend will be unable to receive incentive rewards.

### Internal pre-conditions

Users need to call `matchOffersV3` to match orders when the `currentEpoch` function returns a value of 1.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. When `epoch` is 1, User A calls the `createBorrowOrder` function, and User B calls the `createLendOrder` function.  
2. When `epoch` is 1, calling `incentivizePair` will always revert, resulting in both User A and User B being unable to receive any incentive rewards.

### Impact

Neither borrowers nor lenders can receive incentive rewards, meaning that no one can earn rewards within the first 14 days of the protocol's launch

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add incentive rewards for users either when currentEpoch is 1 or during the creation process
