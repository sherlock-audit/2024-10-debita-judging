# Calculation of the percentage that the borrower will pay to Debita & Connector will be subject to significant rounding down

### Summary

When a borrowing offer is matched against one or more lending offers, the borrower will pay a percentage fee from the principal he'll receive to Debita and the Connector that's calculated [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L391).

The issue happens that in certain durations (which will be more common than not) rounding down will be bound to happen and the protocol (Debita) as well as the Connector will receive less fees than expected

### Root Cause

The root cause is not accounting the rounding down in certain durations - which will be significant in some durations such as - 7 days and 8 hours.

In 7 days and 8 hours, the seconds will be `633_600`, the fee per day is a constant of `4` representing 0.04% and the dividor is `86_400`, representing the seconds per day.

This will result in `633_600` * `4` -> `2_534_400` / `86_400` = `29.33`, thus rounding down to `29.33` and losing more than 1% of the fee that should have been paid.
 
Remember, this will happen on each principal that is on each borrowing offer - basically every single time a lending and a borrowing offers are being matched - this will result in the protocol **receives less fees than expected**,
 as well as the Connector **getting a smaller share of the fee** he should've gotten.

This will accumulate very fast and result in significantly less fees to the protocol due to the rounding down in certain scenarios.

### Internal pre-conditions

Depending on the duration, the rounding down could be less significant, or more than 1% in certain scenarios.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Protocol (Debita) and the Connector will receive less fees as well as the borrower paying less fee due to the rounding down.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Account for the remainder when calculating the fee to be paid to the protocol & the Connector
