# Borrower will Pay Higher Fee When Extend The Loan

### Summary

`missingBorrowFee` in `DebitaV3Loan.sol::extendLoan` is miscalculated and will always return highest fee than it should be.


### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan`, additional fee must be paid first for loan to be extended. The additional fee is being calculated with `feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid`. This calculation will return a very big value because `feeOfMaxDeadline` is `block.timestamp + maxDuration` or the total timestamp from January 1, 1970 until the maxDuration of the offer.

This miscalculation will always result the `feeOfMaxDeadline` as `maxFee` because of how big the value is. No matter how long the loan extended, the fee will be paid as maximum fee.
