# Issue with Deleting the Last Index in an Auction Order

**Summary**
The `AuctionFactory::_deleteAuctionOrder` function contains a critical vulnerability specifically related to deleting the last auction order, causing potential contract state corruption and unexpected behavior during the final order removal process.

**Vulnerability Details**
When attempting to delete the last auction order, the current implementation fails to handle the edge case correctly. The function attempts to perform index manipulation logic designed for intermediate orders, which breaks when applied to the last order in the array.

[Key problematic lines:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L145C4-L160C6)
```javasript
      // Attempting to copy last order to current index (which is already the last index)
@>      allActiveAuctionOrders[index] = allActiveAuctionOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1];
      
      // Trying to update index of the last order, which is now address(0)
@>      AuctionOrderIndex[allActiveAuctionOrders[index]] = index;
```

**Impact**
- Potential contract revert when deleting the last order
- Incorrect index management
- Risk of leaving contract in an inconsistent state

**Proof of Concept**
Scenario:

1. Assume there's only one auction order in the system
2. Attempt to delete that (last) auction order
3. Current implementation will fail due to inappropriate index handling

```javascript
function testLastOrderDeletion() {
    // Single order scenario
    activeOrdersCount = 1;
    address lastOrder = allActiveAuctionOrders[0];
    
    // Calling _deleteAuctionOrder will cause issues:
    // - Attempts to copy last order to its own index
    // - Tries to update index of a zero address
    _deleteAuctionOrder(lastOrder);
}
```
Attack Vectors

- State Corruption: Incorrect handling of the last order's deletion
- Index Inconsistency: Potential zeroing of critical index mappings
- Contract Reliability: Compromised auction order management

**Recommended Mitigation**
To solve this issue, consider updating the `_deleteAuctionOrder` function.
```diff
function _deleteAuctionOrder(address _AuctionOrder) external onlyAuctions {
        // get index of the Auction order
        uint index = AuctionOrderIndex[_AuctionOrder];

+      if (index == activeOrdersCount - 1) {
        // Directly clear the last order
+        allActiveAuctionOrders[index] = address(0);
        
        // Remove the index mapping
+       delete AuctionOrderIndex[_AuctionOrder];
        
        // Decrement active orders count
+       activeOrdersCount--;
        
+       return;
+   }

     
        AuctionOrderIndex[_AuctionOrder] = 0;

        // get last Auction order
        allActiveAuctionOrders[index] = allActiveAuctionOrders[
            activeOrdersCount - 1
        ];
        // take out last Auction order
        allActiveAuctionOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

        // switch index of the last Auction order to the deleted Auction order
        AuctionOrderIndex[allActiveAuctionOrders[index]] = index;
        activeOrdersCount--;
        
    }
```
