# Lender may loose part of the interest he has accrued if he makes his lend offer perpetual after a loan has been extended by the borrower

### Summary

The ``DebitaV3Loan.sol`` contract allows borrowers to extend their loan against certain fees by calling the [extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function:
```solidity
    function extendLoan() public {
                ...
                /* 
                CHECK IF CURRENT LENDER IS THE OWNER OF THE OFFER & IF IT'S PERPETUAL FOR INTEREST
                */
                DLOImplementation lendOffer = DLOImplementation(
                    offer.lendOffer
                );
                DLOImplementation.LendInfo memory lendInfo = lendOffer
                    .getLendInfo();
                address currentOwnerOfOffer;

                try ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) returns (
                    address _lenderOwner
                ) {
                    currentOwnerOfOffer = _lenderOwner;
                } catch {}

                if (
                    lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer
                ) {
                    IERC20(offer.principle).approve(
                        address(lendOffer),
                        interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita
                    );
                    lendOffer.addFunds(
                        interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita
                    );
                } else {
                    loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestToClaim +=
                        interestOfUsedTime -
                        interestToPayToDebita;
                }
                loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestPaid += interestOfUsedTime;
            }
        }
        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));
    }
```
The [extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function, also calculates the interest that is owed to the lenders up to the point the function is called. As can be seen from the above code snippet if the lend order is not perpetual the accrued interest will be added to the ``interestToClaim`` field. Now if a loan has been extended by the borrower, and a lender decides he wants to make his lend order perpetual(meaning that any generated interest, which may come from other loans as well, will be directly deposited to his lend order contract), but doesn't first claim his interest he will loose the interest that has been accrued up to the point the loan was extended. When the borrower repays his loan via the [payDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L186-L257) function:
```solidity
    function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
            ...

            DLOImplementation lendOffer = DLOImplementation(offer.lendOffer);
            DLOImplementation.LendInfo memory lendInfo = lendOffer
                .getLendInfo();

            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                IERC20(offer.principle),
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                total
            );
            // if the lender is the owner of the offer and the offer is perpetual, then add the funds to the offer
            if (lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer) {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
                IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);
                lendOffer.addFunds(total);
            } else {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim =
                    interest -
                    feeOnInterest;
            }

            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                IERC20(offer.principle),
                msg.sender,
                feeAddress,
                feeOnInterest
            );

            loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestPaid += interest;
        }
        // update total count paid
        loanData.totalCountPaid += indexes.length;

        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));
        // check owner
    }
```
As can be seen from the above code snippet if the lend order is perpetual the intrest generated after the loan has been extended will be directly send to the lend offer contract alongside with the principal of the loan, and the ``debtClaimed`` will be set to true. This prohibits the user from calling the [claimDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L271-L286) function later on in order to receive the interest he accrued before the loan was extended. This results in the lender loosing the interest he has generated before the loan was extended, which based on the amount of the loan, the duration and the APR may be a significant amount. Keep in mind that most users of the protocol are not experienced web3 developers or auditors and most probably won't be tracking if and when a loan has been extended. They will expect that after certain time has passed, they will be able to claim their interest, or if they have set their lend order to be a perpetual one, they will expect just to sit back, and generate interest. 

### Root Cause

The [payDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L186-L257) function sets the ``debtClaimed``  to true, if a lend order is perpetual. The lender can't call the [claimDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L271-L286) function in order to get his accrued interest, if he had any before the [payDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L186-L257) function was called  by the borrower to repay his debt. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Borrow and Lend Orders are matched, the Lend orders are not perpetual
2. Several days after the loan has been created pass, the borrower decides to extend the loan
3. Some of the lenders decide to make their lend orders perpetual, without first claiming the interest they have generated before the loan was extended.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

In a scenario where a borrower extends a loan, and later on a lender makes his lend order a perpetual one, the lender will loose the interest he accrued before the loan was extended. Based on factors such as loan duration, APR and amount those losses may be significant. Those funds will be locked in the contract forever.

### Mitigation

Consider implementing a separate function just for claiming interest.
