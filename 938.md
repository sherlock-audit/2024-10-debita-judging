# Core contracts do not implement onERC721Received() which prevents use of NFTs as collateral in protocol

### Summary

In the following contracts:
- DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol
- DebitaV3Aggregator.sol
- DebitaV3Loan.sol

The ERC721Holder.sol contract is imported, however **none of the above contracts inherit from it**. As a result, these contracts cannot receive any NFTs.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L85

These contract cannot received NFTs as `transferFrom()` would a revert as a result of these contract not implementing `onERC721Received()`

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Breaks core protocol functionalities
- NFT backed borrow orders would not be possible (DBO-Implementation contract cannot receive NFTs)
- Order matching would fail for NFT-backed borrow orders (NFT cannot be transferred to Aggregator & DebitaV3Loan contract)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the contract declarations to inherit from `ERC721Holder`
