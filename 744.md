# Missing Scaling of maxRatio Without Oracle Leads to Incorrect Collateral Calculations

**Description:**

Severity : High
Likelihood : High

In the `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3` function, there's a critical issue concerning the scaling of `maxRatio` when oracles are not used. Specifically, when the oracle is **not activated** for a lender's collateral-principle pair, the code assigns `maxRatio` directly from `lendInfo.maxRatio[collateralIndex]` without adjusting for token decimals. This leads to incorrect calculations in subsequent steps.

The problematic code segment is:

   ```solidity
   else {
       // Oracle is not used
       // Get the decimals of the principle and collateral tokens
       uint principleDecimals = ERC20(principles[principleIndex]).decimals();
       uint collateralDecimals = ERC20(borrowInfo.valuableAsset).decimals();

       // Adjust maxRatio for token decimals
       maxRatio = lendInfo.maxRatio[collateralIndex] * (10 ** principleDecimals) / (10 ** collateralDecimals);
   }
   ```

Later in the function, `maxRatio` is used to calculate the `userUsedCollateral`:

```solidity
uint ratio = (maxRatio * porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder[i]) / 10000;
uint userUsedCollateral = (lendAmountPerOrder[i] * (10 ** decimalsCollateral)) / ratio;
```

#### **Issue Explanation**

When oracles are **not activated** for a lender's collateral-principal pair, the code assigns `maxRatio` directly from `lendInfo.maxRatio[collateralIndex]` without adjusting for differences in token decimals between the collateral and principal tokens. This leads to unit mismatches in subsequent calculations.

**Unscaled `maxRatio`:**

- **Problem:** The `maxRatio` value represents the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio set by the lender for a specific collateral. However, without scaling `maxRatio` to account for the decimal differences between the collateral and principal tokens, the ratio does not accurately reflect the correct proportion of collateral to principal.
- **Consequence:** Since tokens can have varying decimal places (e.g., USDC has 6 decimals, while ETH has 18 decimals), failing to adjust `maxRatio` means the units used in calculations are inconsistent, leading to incorrect amounts.

**Incorrect `userUsedCollateral`:**

- **Dependency on `maxRatio`:** The calculation of `userUsedCollateral`—the amount of collateral required from the borrower—relies on `ratio`, which is derived from `maxRatio`.
  
  ```solidity
  uint ratio = (maxRatio * porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder[i]) / 10000;
  uint userUsedCollateral = (lendAmountPerOrder[i] * (10 ** decimalsCollateral)) / ratio;
  ```
  
- **Miscalculation:** Without properly scaled `maxRatio`, the `ratio` used here does not correctly represent the proportion between the principal and collateral tokens. This results in `userUsedCollateral` being either too high or too low.
  
  - **Example Scenario:**
    - **Collateral Token:** 6 decimals (e.g., USDC)
    - **Principal Token:** 18 decimals (e.g., ETH)
    - **Unscaled `maxRatio`:** Value without considering decimal differences.
    - **Result:** The calculation `(lendAmountPerOrder[i] * (10 ** decimalsCollateral)) / ratio` uses mismatched units, leading to an inaccurate `userUsedCollateral`.

**Impact:**


- **Broken Core Functionality:**
  - LTV ratios become meaningless as actual collateral-to-principle ratio differs from intended
  - Interest calculations based on wrong principle amounts

- **Loss of User Funds:**
  - Lenders risk significant losses due to under-collateralized positions
  - Borrowers lose access to capital due to excessive collateral requirements
  - Protocol's economic incentives completely misaligned with intended design
---

**Recommended Mitigation:**

1. **Scale `maxRatio` Appropriately When Oracles Are Not Used:**

   - **Retrieve Token Decimals:** Obtain the decimals for both the principle and collateral tokens using `ERC20(token).decimals()`.

   - **Adjust `maxRatio`:** Scale `maxRatio` to account for the difference in decimals between the principle and collateral tokens.

2. **Modify the Code in `matchOffersV3`:**

   Update the else block to include scaling:

   ```solidity
   else {
       // Get the decimals of the principle and collateral tokens
       uint principleDecimals = ERC20(principles[principleIndex]).decimals();
       uint collateralDecimals = ERC20(borrowInfo.valuableAsset).decimals();

       // Adjust maxRatio for token decimals
       maxRatio = lendInfo.maxRatio[collateralIndex] * (10 ** principleDecimals) / (10 ** collateralDecimals);
   }
   ```
By scaling `maxRatio`, you ensure that it correctly represents the ratio in terms compatible with the token decimals involved.
