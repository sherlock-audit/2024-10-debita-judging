# borrowOrderIndex could easily get messed up

### Summary

the `deleteBorrowOrder` function inside of `DBOFactory` doesnt take account of the item at `index 0`, any deleted items now would live on `index 0`, whereas `index 0` is a valid index

item to be deleted doesn't get assigned to the last index,

### Root Cause

[deleteBorrowOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L162) assigns the item to be deleted to `index 0` instead of the last index
