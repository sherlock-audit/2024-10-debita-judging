### Attack Path

Following is the information about `MixOracle` extracted from the [Debita's documentation](https://debita-finance.gitbook.io/debita-v3/lending/oracles) for context:

> To integrate a token without a direct oracle, a mix oracle is utilized. This oracle uses a TWAP oracle to compute the conversion rate between Token A and Token B. Token B must be supported on PYTH oracle, and the pricing pool should have substantial liquidity to ensure security.
>
> This approach enables us to obtain the USD valuation of tokens that would otherwise would be impossible.

The following attempts to walk through how the MixOracle is used for reader understanding before jumping into the issue.

WFTM token is supported on Pyth Oracle via the `WFTM/USD` price feed, but there is no oracle in Fantom Chain that supports EQUAL token. Thus, the `MixOracle` can be leveraged to provide the price of the EQUAL token even though no EQUAL price oracle exists. A pricing pool with substantial liquidity that consists of EQUAL token can be used here.

Let's use the WFTM/EQUAL pool (EQUALPAIR = [0x3d6c56f6855b7Cc746fb80848755B0a9c3770122](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x3d6c56f6855b7cc746fb80848755b0a9c3770122)) from Equalizer within the test script for illustration.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/test/fork/Loan/ltv/Tarot-Fantom/OracleTarotUSDCEQUAL.t.sol#L138

```solidity
File: OracleTarotUSDCEQUAL.t.sol
136:     function testUSDCPrincipleAndEqualCollateral() public {
137:         createOffers(USDC, EQUAL);
138:         DebitaMixOracle.setAttachedTarotPriceOracle(EQUALPAIR);
139:         vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1201);
140:         int priceEqual = DebitaMixOracle.getThePrice(EQUAL);
```

The token0 and token1 of the WFTM/EQUAL pool are as follows as retrieved from the FTMscan:

- token0 = [0x21be370D5312f44cB42ce377BC9b8a0cEF1A4C83](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x21be370D5312f44cB42ce377BC9b8a0cEF1A4C83) = WFTM

- token1 = [0x3Fd3A0c85B70754eFc07aC9Ac0cbBDCe664865A6](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x3Fd3A0c85B70754eFc07aC9Ac0cbBDCe664865A6) = EQUAL

In this case, the price returned from the pool will be computed by EQUAL divided by WFTM. So, the price of EQUAL per WFTM is provided by the pool.

```solidity
Equalizer Pool's getPriceCumulativeCurrent = reserve1/reserve0 = token1/token0 = EQUAL/WFTM
```

When configuring the `MixOracle` to support EQUAL token, the `setAttachedTarotPriceOracle` will be executed, and the pool address ([0x3d6c56f6855b7Cc746fb80848755B0a9c3770122](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x3d6c56f6855b7cc746fb80848755b0a9c3770122)) will be passing in via the `uniswapV2Pair` parameter. In this case, the `MixOracle` will return the price of the EQUAL (token1) token when the `MixOracle.getThePrice(EQUAL)` function is executed within another part of the protocol.

```solidity
AttachedPricedToken[token1] = token0;
AttachedPricedToken[EQUAL] = WFTM;
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/MixOracle/MixOracle.sol#L72

```solidity
File: MixOracle.sol
72:     function setAttachedTarotPriceOracle(address uniswapV2Pair) public {
73:         require(multisig == msg.sender, "Only multisig can set price feeds");
74: 
75:         require(
76:             AttachedUniswapPair[uniswapV2Pair] == address(0),
77:             "Uniswap pair already set"
78:         );
79: 
80:         address token0 = IUniswapV2Pair(uniswapV2Pair).token0();
81:         address token1 = IUniswapV2Pair(uniswapV2Pair).token1();
82:         require(
83:             AttachedTarotOracle[token1] == address(0),
84:             "Price feed already set"
85:         );
86:         DebitaProxyContract tarotOracle = new DebitaProxyContract(
87:             tarotOracleImplementation
88:         );
89:         ITarotOracle oracle = ITarotOracle(address(tarotOracle));
90:         oracle.initialize(uniswapV2Pair);
91:         AttachedUniswapPair[token1] = uniswapV2Pair;
92:         AttachedTarotOracle[token1] = address(tarotOracle);
93:         AttachedPricedToken[token1] = token0;
94:         isFeedAvailable[uniswapV2Pair] = true;
95:     }
```

The issue is that the `MixOracle` relies on the position of token0 and token1 in the pool that cannot be controlled. Within the pool (Equalizer or Uniswap Pool), the position of token0 and token1 is pre-determined and sorted by the token's address (smaller address will always be token0)

However, the position of the token in the `setAttachedTarotPriceOracle `function is hardcoded. For instance, the keys of the `AttachedUniswapPair`, `AttachedTarotOracle`, `AttachedPricedToken` mapping are all hardcoded to `token1`.

Assume that the protocol wants to create another `MixOracle` to support another token called $Token_X$ that does not have any oracle on Fantom. However, this token to be supported is located in the position of `token0` instead of `token1` in the pool. Thus, because the `MixOracle` is hardcoded to always use only `token1`, there is no way to support this $Token_X$ even though a high liquidity pool that consists of $Token_X$ exists on Fantom.

The `MixOracle` is supposed to work in this scenario, but due to hardcoded position, it cannot supported. Thus, the `MixOracle` is broken in this scenario.

### Impact

Medium. Breaks core contract functionality. Oracle is a core feature in a protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider not hardcoding the position (`token1`) as the key of the mapping used within `MixOracle`. Instead, allow the deployer to specify which token (`token0` or `token1`) the `MixOracle` is supposed to support.
