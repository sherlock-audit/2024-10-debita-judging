# An attacker can wipe the orderbook in buyOrderFactory.sol

### Summary

A malicious actor can wipe the complete buy order orderbook in `buyOrderFactory.sol`. The attack - excluding gas costs - does not bear any financial burden on the attacker. As a result of the exploit, the orderbook will be temporarily inaccessible in the factory, leading to a DoS state in buy order matching, and in closing and selling existing positions.

### Root Cause

The function `sellNFT(uint receiptID)` lacks reentrancy protection:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `createBuyOrder(address _token, address wantedToken, uint _amount, uint ratio)` with exploit contract supplied in parameter `wantedToken`
2. Attacker calls `sellNFT(uint receiptID)` which triggers the exploit sequence
3. Exploit contract will reenter `sellNFT` multiple times, triggering a cascade of buy order deletions

### Impact

The orderbook in `buyOrderFactory.sol` will be inaccessible. The function `getActiveBuyOrders(uint offset, uint limit)` is used by off-chain services to gather buy order data - this data will be temporarily blocked. Deleting existing buy orders (`deleteBuyOrder()`) and selling NFTs (`sellNFT(uint receiptID)`) will also be temporarily blocked until the issue is resolved manually. Issue can be resolved manually by:
- Opening dummy buy orders with very little collateral
- Closing/selling positions on existing "legit" orders

### PoC

Note: the PoC is somewhat hastily developed as the audit deadline is quite short relative to the project scope. Executing the PoC with the verbose flag (forge test -vvvv) will show that deletion is triggered multiple times.

### Mitigation

Apply reentrancy protection on the function `sellNFT(uint receiptID)`:
