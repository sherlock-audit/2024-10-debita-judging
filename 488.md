# BuyOrderFactory owner will fail to transfer ownership due to incorrect ownership assignment in the contract

### Summary

The incorrect ownership assignment in the `changeOwner` function will cause a failure to transfer ownership for the contract owner, as the current implementation assigns the `owner` variable to itself rather than the `newOwner` parameter. This results in the contract owner permanently retaining control unless redeployed, leading to governance and maintainability challenges.


### Root Cause

In [buyOrderFactory.sol:186](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186:L190)
the assignment in the `changeOwner` function incorrectly sets `owner = owner` instead of `owner = _newOwner`.
```Solidity
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```
### Attack Path

1.  The current owner calls the `changeOwner` function with a valid `_newOwner` address within the first 6 hours after contract deployment.
2.  The function executes but incorrectly assigns `owner = owner` instead of `owner = _newOwner`.
3.  Ownership is not transferred, and the contract remains under the control of the original owner.


### Impact

The contract owner cannot transfer ownership, permanently locking the administrative control of the contract to the deployer. This prevents governance actions (e.g., adjusting fees or upgrading proxies) from being delegated or handed over in the future.

### PoC

Please add this test function to `BuyOrder.t.sol`
```Solidity
function testChangeBuyOrderFactoryOwner() public {
        // Normal scenario 
        vm.startPrank(factory.owner()); //0x7FA9385bE102ac3EAc297483Dd6233D62b3e1496
        vm.expectRevert();
        factory.changeOwner(newOwner); // revert: Only owner
        vm.stopPrank();
        // The function's working scenario
        vm.startPrank(newOwner); //0xc4FBD869f902eC895ADfF4e900d89C32AC403Ea2
        factory.changeOwner(newOwner); // pass 
        vm.stopPrank();
        // The function did not revert, and the owner remained unchanged        
        assertNotEq(factory.owner(), newOwner); // 0x7FA9385bE102ac3EAc297483Dd6233D62b3e1496 != 0xc4FBD869f902eC895ADfF4e900d89C32AC403Ea2
}
```


### Mitigation

```Solidity
function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = _newOwner;
}
```
