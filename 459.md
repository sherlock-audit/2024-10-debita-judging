# DebitaChainlink does not check the last update timestamp of the price feed data

### Summary

In `debitaChainlink.sol` the `getThePrice` function fails to check the last update timestamp of the price feed. This allows stale price data to be used, especially in cases where the price feed is delayed or disrupted, leading to potential inaccuracies.

### Price Monitoring Bot:

> We will have a bot constantly monitoring the price of pairs. If there is a difference greater than 5%, the oracle will be paused until it stabilizes again.

While the proposed bot-based monitoring system helps detect price anomalies, it cannot fully address the risks associated with stale price data due to the following limitations:
1.	**Gradual Price Drift:** Stale prices can drift over time, remaining within the botâ€™s acceptable deviation threshold (5%). This means the bot may not flag the issue until the discrepancy becomes significant.
2.	**Delayed Detection:** By the time the bot detects a problem, users or the platform may have already incurred significant financial losses.
3.	**Single Point of Failure:** The bot is an external system. If it fails or lags behind in its monitoring duties, stale prices may still be used.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaChainlink.sol:42](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L42)
the `timestamp` from `latestRoundDate` is ignored:
```solidity
(, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The Chainlink data feed may deliver outdated prices that deviate less than 5% from the correct value, which falls within the acceptable threshold for the bot, preventing it from detecting the deviation and pausing the oracle.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

A deviation in price data for a lender-borrower protocol can result in substantial risks, such as incorrect liquidations, unfair borrower treatment, and increased opportunities for exploitation.

### Mitigation

```diff solidity
+ uint256 public constant MAX_DELAY = 1 hours;

function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
    address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
    require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
    require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");

    AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

    // If sequencer is set, check if it's up
    if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
        checkSequencer();
    }
-    ( , int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
+    ( , int price, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

    require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
    require(price > 0, "Invalid price");

+    // Timestamp validation to ensure freshness
+    require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= MAX_DELAY, "Stale price data");

    return price;
