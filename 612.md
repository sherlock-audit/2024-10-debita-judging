# lenders can lose funds

### Summary

when users call claimdebt when the loan is paid it calls claimdebt

    function claimDebt(uint index) external nonReentrant {
        IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);
        infoOfOffers memory offer = loanData._acceptedOffers[index];


        require(
            ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) == msg.sender,
            "Not lender"
        );
        // check if the offer has been paid, if not just call claimInterest function
        if (offer.paid) {
            _claimDebt(index);

the problem is that when users claim their debt the function first burns the lenderid  ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID);



    function _claimDebt(uint index) internal {
        LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
        IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);


        infoOfOffers memory offer = m_loan._acceptedOffers[index];
        require(
            ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) == msg.sender,
            "Not lender"
        );
        require(offer.paid == true, "Not paid");
        require(offer.debtClaimed == false, "Already claimed");
        loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
        ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID); ////---->snip 
        uint interest = offer.interestToClaim;
        offer.interestToClaim = 0;


        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(offer.principle),
            msg.sender,
            interest + offer.principleAmount
        );

now if while claiming the debt the transfer fails due to low balance in the contract the lenders ownership id will get burned which will leave him unable to claim his amount back

### Impact

loss of funds for the lender

### PoC



if the loan principal amount is greater than the contracts balance at the moment the lender calls claim debt the lender
the function will fail to transfer the debt back to the lender but the lenders id will already get burned

### Mitigation

only burn the lenders lenderid when the claim debt is executed successfully  check if the
