### Attack Path

Multiple instances of the issues issue were found across the codebase.

**Instance 1 - Borrow Offer**

The `borrowInformation.availableAmount` is reduced by `amount` in the memory at Line 147 below. However, the update is not written back to the storage. As a result, the borrow order has an infinite amount of collateral since it never gets reduced.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L147

```solidity
File: DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol
137:     function acceptBorrowOffer(
138:         uint amount
139:     ) public onlyAggregator nonReentrant onlyAfterTimeOut {
140:         BorrowInfo memory m_borrowInformation = getBorrowInfo();
141:         require(
142:             amount <= m_borrowInformation.availableAmount,
143:             "Amount exceeds available amount"
144:         );
145:         require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
146: 
147:         borrowInformation.availableAmount -= amount;
```

Assume that at $T0$  Bob's borrow order has `borrowInformation.availableAmount` = 1000 USDC and 1000 USDC residing on his borrow order contract.

At $T1$, an aggregator matched Bob's borrow order and `acceptBorrowOffer(300 USDC)` is executed. Thus, 300 USDC will be transferred out from Bob's borrowing order to the Loan contract to be held as collateral. The `borrowInformation.availableAmount` will remain at 1000 USDC because the update is not saved to the storage. After the transaction, the state will be as follows:

- `borrowInformation.availableAmount` = 1000 USDC
- USDC balance on Bob's borrow order = 700 USDC (1000 - 300)

At $T2$, Bob wants to cancel his borrow order to withdraw his remaining USDC in his borrow order. When the `cancelOffer()` is executed, `availableAmount` at Line 190 below will be 1000 USDC, and the code will attempt to transfer 1000 USDC at Line 210 below. However, due to insufficient funds (1000USDC vs 700USDC), the transfer will revert. Thus, Bob's assets are stuck in the order.

```solidity
File: DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol
188:     function cancelOffer() public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
189:         BorrowInfo memory m_borrowInformation = getBorrowInfo();
190:         uint availableAmount = m_borrowInformation.availableAmount;
191:         require(availableAmount > 0, "No available amount");
192:         // set available amount to 0
193:         // set isActive to false
194:         borrowInformation.availableAmount = 0;
195:         isActive = false;
..SNIP..
206:         } else {
207:             SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
208:                 IERC20(m_borrowInformation.collateral),
209:                 msg.sender,
210:                 availableAmount
211:             );
212:         }
```

**Instance 2 - Lend Offer**

The `lendInformation.availableAmount` is reduced by `amount` in the memory at Line 120 below. However, the update is not written back to the storage. As a result, the lending order has an infinite amount of collateral since it never gets reduced.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L120

```solidity
File: DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol
109:     function acceptLendingOffer(
110:         uint amount
111:     ) public onlyAggregator nonReentrant onlyAfterTimeOut {
112:         LendInfo memory m_lendInformation = lendInformation;
113:         uint previousAvailableAmount = m_lendInformation.availableAmount;
114:         require(
115:             amount <= m_lendInformation.availableAmount,
116:             "Amount exceeds available amount"
117:         );
118:         require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
119: 
120:         lendInformation.availableAmount -= amount;
```

Similar to the scenario in Instance 1, in this case, it is the lender's assets being stuck as the transfer in Line 154 below will revert due to insufficient funds.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L154

```solidity
File: DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol
144:     function cancelOffer() public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
145:         uint availableAmount = lendInformation.availableAmount;
146:         lendInformation.perpetual = false;
147:         lendInformation.availableAmount = 0;
148:         require(availableAmount > 0, "No funds to cancel");
149:         isActive = false;
150: 
151:         SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
152:             IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
153:             msg.sender,
154:             availableAmount
155:         );
```

**Instance 3 - Loan/Auction**

The `loanData.auctionInitialized` is set to `true` at Line 455 below. However, the update is not written back to the storage. As a result, the protocol will wronly assume that the loan was never auctioned.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L455

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Loan.sol
417:     function createAuctionForCollateral(
418:         uint indexOfLender
419:     ) external nonReentrant {
420:         LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
..SNIP..
455:         loanData.auctionInitialized = true;
```
