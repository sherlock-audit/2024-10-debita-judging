# When a loan is extended a lender may loose part of the interest he is owed

### Summary

The ``DebitaV3Loan`` contract allows borrowers to extend their loan, if the lend offers allow it. For example if the initial duration set in the borrow offer was 10 days, but the max duration of the lend orders that were matched with the borrow order is 30 days, in a later date the borrower may decide to extend his loan by calling the [extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function:
```solidity
    function extendLoan() public {
                ...

                if (
                    lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer
                ) {
                    IERC20(offer.principle).approve(
                        address(lendOffer),
                        interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita
                    );
                    lendOffer.addFunds(
                        interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita
                    );
                } else {
                    loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestToClaim +=
                        interestOfUsedTime -
                        interestToPayToDebita;
                }
                loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestPaid += interestOfUsedTime;
            }
        }
        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));
    }
```
In the [extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function there are a couple of calculation that calculate the extra fees the borrower has to pay, one of them is the interest that has been accrued since the loan was created. As can be seen from the code snippet above the borrower transfers the accrued interest and the ``interestToClaim`` and the  ``interestPaid`` fileds for the lend offer are increased. Or if the lend order is perpetual the funds are directly transferred to the lend order. However when a borrower repays a certain lend order via the [payDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L186-L257) function, the previous interestToClaim is disregarded:
```solidity
    function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
            ...
            // if the lender is the owner of the offer and the offer is perpetual, then add the funds to the offer
            if (lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer) {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
                IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);
                lendOffer.addFunds(total);
            } else {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim =
                    interest -
                    feeOnInterest;
            }

            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                IERC20(offer.principle),
                msg.sender,
                feeAddress,
                feeOnInterest
            );

            loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestPaid += interest;
        }
        ...
    }
```

As can be seen from the code snippet above if for example 2 days have passed since the borrower extended the loan, and now he repays the certain lend offer, the ``interestToClaim`` will be set to the new interest, which is the interest accrued for the 2 days that passed. Lets say that 10 days have passed since the loan was created, then the borrower extended the loan, 2 more days passed and he repaid a certain lend order. That lend order will get interest only for 2 days, essentially loosing the interest for 10 days. Lenders may call the [claimDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L271-L286) function, once a loan have been extended in order to collect their interest up to that moment, however lenders are not expected to track if loans have been extended, and take action. There is also the possibility of a malicious borrower, who extends the loan and immediately repays the lend orders, this way all lenders will receive 0 interest, and the interest that they should have received will be locked in the contract forever. Depending on the amounts of the loan, the APR, and the duration the losses may be devastating. Essentially lenders would have given their money to someone expecting a certain return, but after not having access to their funds for a duration of time, they won't receive any return in the form of interest, thus the high severity. 

### Root Cause

In the [payDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L186-L257) function, the ``interestToClaim`` is set to the latest calculated interest, 
```solidity
loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim =
                    interest -
                    feeOnInterest;
```
which doesn't take into consideration any previously generated interest. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The borrower extends the loan
2. Either the lenders don't pay attention to the fact that the loan has been extended and they don't claim their interest before their lend offer is repaid, or the borrower is malicious and directly repays all the lend offers, after he has extended the loan. 

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Lenders will loose part/all of the interest they are supposed to receive for lending their money. The funds will be locked in the contract forever.

### Mitigation

In the [payDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L186-L257) function, instead of setting the ``interestToClaim`` to the latest calculated interest, 
```solidity
loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim =
                    interest -
                    feeOnInterest;
```
add the latest generated interest to the ``interestToClaim``
