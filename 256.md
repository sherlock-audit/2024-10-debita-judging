# Protocol fails to validate Chainlink's minAnswer and maxAnswer values

### Summary

`DebitaChainlink::getThePrice` function fails to validate if returned prices from Chainlink oracles are within the acceptable boundaries defined by minAnswer and maxAnswer. This is particularly critical for deployment on Arbitrum, where these are actively used on major feeds.



### Root Cause

`DebitaChainlink::getThePrice` function disregards Chainlink's minAnswer and maxAnswer values. According to Chainlink docs:

> The data feed aggregator includes both minAnswer and maxAnswer values. On most data feeds, these values are no longer used and they do not stop your application from reading the most recent answer. For monitoring purposes, you must decide what limits are acceptable for your application.

But these values **ARE USED** in the case of most feeds (including ETH and most stablecoins) on **Arbitrum**, which, the protocol will be deployed on. See:

> On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
> Sonic (Prev. Fantom), Base, Arbitrum & OP

To see the values, refer to ETH/USD aggregator as an example => https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3607e46698d218B3a5Cae44bF381475C0a5e2ca7#readContract

```solidity
   function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```
The function only validates that the price is positive but doesn't check if it falls within the oracle's acceptable range. On Arbitrum, Chainlink price feeds implement circuit breakers through minAnswer and maxAnswer values. If an asset's price moves beyond these boundaries:

The oracle will continue reporting the boundary value instead of the actual price
This creates a discrepancy between the reported price and market reality
The current implementation would accept these capped values as valid
