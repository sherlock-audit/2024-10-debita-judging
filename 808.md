# Loss of the entire collatteral for the lenders when the auction is yet to initialise.




### Summary

The return value of `claimCollateralAsNFTLender(index)` is not taken care inside `claimCollateralAsLender()`.

As a result when a `lender` calls `claimCollateralAsLender()` he loses all the collatteral if the `auction` has not been intitialized.

### Root Cause
`claimCollateralAsNFTLender(index)` returns `true` if the `auction` is initialised or if there is only one `lender`.
But in the case if there are multiple `lenders` and `auction` is still waiting for initialization, the function will return `false`.

This function is called by claimCollateralAsLender() if the collatteral is an NFT.

```solidity
        if (m_loan.isCollateralNFT) {
            claimCollateralAsNFTLender(index);
        } 
```

Since here we are not checking whether the return value is false, the transaction continues executing and burns the ownershipOf the lender(lenderId) and mark the collateralClaimed[lender] as true.

As a result, protocol considered lender has claimed the collatteral when they are actually not.

### Internal pre-conditions
Auction is not intitialised.
deadline has passed and the Lenders can call claimCollatteral


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Loss of the entire collatteral for the lenders when the auction has not yet been initialise.

### PoC
_No response_

### Mitigation

validate the return avalue of   claimCollateralAsNFTLender(index); and revert the transaction if it is false.
