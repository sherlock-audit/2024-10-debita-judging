# Inability to Change Ownership Due to Variable Shadowing

### Summary

The ` DebitaV3Aggregator::changeOwner` function in does not correctly update the `owner` due to a shadowed variable issue. As a result, the owner cannot successfully change their address, and the contract's ownership remains immutable after deployment. If the owner's address gets compromised, the protocol team do not have a chance to take quick actions of changing ownership.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Aggregator.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682), the function parameter `owner` shadows the state variable `owner`, causing the check `require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner")` to always revert. since the `owner` variable within the function only references the function argument and not the state variable.
```solidity
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
    //@audit this will always revert when there is an intention to change ownership
  @>>require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner;
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Any attempt to change the contract ownership

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The protocol will be unable to change ownership. In the event that the current ownerâ€™s address is compromised, it will be impossible to transfer ownership to a secure address, resulting in a permanent loss of control over the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix the issue, rename the function parameter to avoid shadowing the state variable.
```solidity
function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = _owner;
}
```
