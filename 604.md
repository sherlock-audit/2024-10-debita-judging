# Conflicting variable names render changeOwner function in DebitaV3Aggregator.sol ineffective

### Summary

The name of the variable in the `changeOwner(address owner)` function's input parameter is incorrect, as it corresponds exactly to the `owner` state variable in the contract. This causes the function not to perform the require  as expected and not to modify the value of `owner`.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682
In DebitaV3Aggregator.sol::changeOwner() function, there is a name conflict. Indeed, the local variable `owner` (the function parameter) hides the state variable `owner` declared at the top of the contract.
The require doesn't check if the `msg.sender` is the real `owner`(state variable) but if the `owner` local variable of the function is equal to `msg.sender`.
The assignment owner = owner simply assigns the value of the `owner` local variable to itself, without ever modifying the contract's `owner` state variable.

### Attack Path

Owner of the contract tries to changes the variable `owner` using `changeOwner()`.

### Impact

The contract's `owner` state variable cannot be modified.

### Mitigation

Change the name of the local variable used in the function.
Example: 
```solidity 
 function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, “Only owner”);
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, “6 hours passed");
        owner = newOwner;}
```
