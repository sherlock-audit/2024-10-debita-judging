# A user can create an Auction that never hits it's floor price

### Summary

The Dutch Auction contract allows users to create auctions where the price of a token decreases over time from an initial price (``initAmount``) to a floor price (``floorAmount``). However, the current implementation has a vulnerability: a user can set an arbitrarily high auction duration (``_duration``) such that the price decrement per block (``tickPerBlock``) becomes zero. This causes the auction price to remain constant at the initial amount (``initAmount``), preventing it from ever reaching the floor price and defeating the purpose of a Dutch auction.



### Root Cause

1. **Vulnerability in tickPerBlock Calculation**
In the constructor, tickPerBlock is calculated as:
```solidity
tickPerBlock: (curedInitAmount - curedFloorAmount) / _duration
```
If ``_duration`` is set to an extremely high value, the result of the division becomes zero due to Solidityâ€™s integer truncation. This effectively nullifies the price decrement mechanism.
2. **Price Calculation in getCurrentPrice()**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L228
The ``getCurrentPrice()`` function calculates the auction's current price:

```solidity
uint decreasedAmount = m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock * timePassed;
uint currentPrice = (decreasedAmount >
    (m_currentAuction.initAmount - floorPrice))
    ? floorPrice
    : m_currentAuction.initAmount - decreasedAmount;
```
With ``tickPerBlock = 0``, the decreasedAmount remains zero regardless of how much time has passed.
The currentPrice becomes:
$$currentPrice = m_currentAuction.initAmount - 0 = m_currentAuction.initAmount;$$
This means the price remains constant at initAmount.
4. **Auction Behavior**
A user can exploit this issue by creating an auction with:
- A high ``_duration`` to force tickPerBlock = 0.
- An ``initAmount`` significantly higher than the desired price.
Because the price never decreases, buyers are forced to pay the inflated ``initAmount``, and the auction never reaches the ``floorAmount``.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- The auction no longer decreases the price over time, violating its fundamental purpose.
- Users expecting a fair price progression are denied access to lower prices, making the auction dysfunctional.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Enforce Minimum tickPerBlock**: Add a check in the constructor to ensure tickPerBlock is greater than zero
2. **Set a Maximum _duration**: Limit the maximum auction duration to a reasonable value
