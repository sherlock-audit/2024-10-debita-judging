# Missing `checkOnERC721Received` Check Will Lead to Permanent Loss of NFTs

### Summary


The lack of a `checkOnERC721Received` call in the `cancelOffer` and `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` functions will cause **permanent loss of NFTs** for **protocol users** if the recipient (`msg.sender`) does not implement the `ERC721Receiver` interface. As the **contract transfers NFTs without ensuring the recipient is capable of handling them**, the tokens will be stuck in the recipient's address, violating the expected behavior of a safe transfer.  


### Root Cause


In the [cancelOffer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L200-L205) function:  

```solidity  
IERC721(m_borrowInformation.collateral).transferFrom(  
    address(this),  
    msg.sender,  
    m_borrowInformation.receiptID  
);  
```  

The contract uses `transferFrom` to transfer the NFT, but this function does not ensure the recipient implements the `ERC721Receiver` interface. According to the [OpenZeppelin ERC721 documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721), the `checkOnERC721Received` function should be used to guarantee safe transfers.  

also in DebitaV3Loan: claimCollateralAsNFTLender
```solidity
            // if there is only one offer and the auction has not been initialized
            // send the NFT to the lender
            IERC721(m_loan.collateral).transferFrom(
                address(this),
                msg.sender,
                m_loan.NftID
            );
```

### Internal pre-conditions


1. The `msg.sender` does not implement the `ERC721Receiver` interface, meaning it cannot properly receive NFTs.  
2. The `cancelOffer` function is called, triggering the transfer of an NFT via `transferFrom`.  
3. The NFT becomes permanently inaccessible due to the recipient being incapable of handling it.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The **users** suffer **permanent loss of their NFTs** if their address does not implement the `ERC721Receiver` interface.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Replace the `transferFrom` call with `safeTransferFrom` in the `cancelOffer` function to ensure the `checkOnERC721Received` mechanism is invoked, confirming the recipient can handle the NFT:  

```solidity  
IERC721(m_borrowInformation.collateral).safeTransferFrom(  
    address(this),  
    msg.sender,  
    m_borrowInformation.receiptID  
);  
```
