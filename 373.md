# Borrower has to pay more fee than intended to extend loan

### Summary

Lines [599-613](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L599-L613) contains logic to calculate the additional fee `misingBorrowFee`, a borrower must pay when extending a loan. However, the `feeOfMaxDeadline` is incorrectly calculated, always resulting in it being equal to `maxFee`. This causes the borrower to always pay more fees than intended to extend loan

### Root Cause

1. From `DebitaV3Aggregator` in line [511](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L511) we can see the `maxDeadline` is the sum of `lendInfo.maxDuration` and `block.timestamp`.
2. The formula `feeOfMaxDeadline = (offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) / 86400` in `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan()` uses `offer.maxDeadline`, rather than the extended duration. This makes `feeOfMaxDeadline` directly proportional to the entire maximum loan duration, exceeding maxFee.
3. The condition `if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee)` is always triggered, resulting in `feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee` regardless of intermediate calculations. Borrowers end up paying the maximum fee even when they shouldn't.

### Impact

Borrower pays more than extra fees while extending loan which is not supposed to happen

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. calculate the fee correctly - 
```solidity
feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline - m_loan.startedAt - m_loan.initialDuration) * feePerDay) / 86400
```
This calculates the extra fee borrower should pay because of the extra days of extending the loan
2. After fixing there is a possibility of underflow in line [610](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L610). Add checks for it.
