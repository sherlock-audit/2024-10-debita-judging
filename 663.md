# changeOwner function is broken due to variable shadowing

### Summary

The `changeOwner` function fails to update ownership due to parameter shadowing the state variable owner

### Root Cause

In `changeOwner` function the parameter owner shadows state variable owner, causing state variable to remain unchanged due to self-assignment

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner; //@audit Self assignment, no state change
    }
```

This issue was found in `AuctionFactory.sol` and `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol` contracts.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Function must be called by current owner `(msg.sender == owner)`
2. Must be called within 6 hours of deployment `(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp)`

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Current owner calls `changeOwner` function to transfer the ownership
2. Access control checks pass
3. Due to variable shadowing, `owner = owner` assigns parameter to itself
4. State owner variable remains unchanged
5. Ownership transfer fails silently

### Impact

Protocol functionality is impaired because:

1. Ownership transfers are impossible
2. Protocol is stuck with initial owner
3. If initial owner needs to be changed within first 6 hours, it's not possible

### PoC

No poc

### Mitigation

Change the name of the parameter in the function to be with different name than the state variable.

Example:

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
```
