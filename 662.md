# extendLoan function reverts due to unused time calculation

### Summary

The `extendLoan` function in `DebitaV3Loan` contains an unnecessary calculation that could cause transaction revert when loans are close to their deadline.

### Root Cause

`extendedTime` variable is not used and can cause reverts in some cases which cause some borrowers to not be able to extend their loan

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Borrower needs to have an active loan with `loanData.extended == false`
2. At least 10% of the initial loan duration must have passed
3. The loan must be before its current deadline (nextDeadline() > block.timestamp)
4. The loan must have unpaid offers `(offer.paid == false)`

### External pre-conditions

1. `block.timestamp` must be close to `maxDeadline`
2. maxDeadline - (block.timestamp - startedAt) - block.timestamp < 0

### Attack Path

1. Loan starts at timestamp `1730412000` (November 1)
2. Let's consider that the current time is `1732917600` (November 30)
3. Borrower calls `extendLoan` function
4. For an offer with maxDeadline `1733004000` (December 1)

### Impact

The borrower cannot extend their loan when close to deadline periods due to transaction reversion, despite meeting all other extension requirements. This is a griefing issue as:

1. Might force borrower into default if they can't extend their loan 
2. Borrower loses gas fees on failed transaction
3. Could affect protocol's ability to handle legitimate loan extensions

### PoC

The borrower cannot extend their loan when close to deadline periods due to transaction reversion, despite meeting all other extension requirements. This is a griefing issue as:

1. Might force borrower into default if they can't extend their loan 
2. Borrower loses gas fees on failed transaction
3. Could affect protocol's ability to handle legitimate loan extensions

### POC

This Proof of Concept demonstrates how the unused variable calculation in `extendLoan` causes reverts when the loan is close to its deadline.

We use 3 specific timestamps to showcase the issue:

1. loanStartedAt: 1730412000 (Nov 1, 2024 00:00)
2. currentTime: 1732917600 (Nov 30, 2024 00:00)
3. maxDeadline: 1733004000 (Dec 1, 2024 00:00)

The calculation flow:

1. alreadyUsedTime = 1732917600 - 1730412000 = 2,505,600 (≈29 days)
2. extendedTime = 1733004000 - 2,505,600 - 1732917600
= 1733004000 - 1735423200
= -2,419,200 (reverts due to underflow)

**Explained calculation with variable names**

1. alreadyUsedTime = `currentTime` - `loanStartedAt` = 2,505,600 (≈29 days)
2. extendedTime = `maxDeadline` - `alreadyUsedTime` - `currentTime` = -2,419,200 (reverts due to underflow)



```solidity
contract ExtendLoanBug {

    event Log(string);

    uint256 loanStartedAt = 1730412000; // 1 November 00:00 time
    uint256 currentTime = 1732917600; // 30 November 00:00 time
    uint256 maxDeadline = 1733004000; // 1 December 00:00 time

    function extendLoan() public { 
        uint256 alreadyUsedTime = currentTime - loanStartedAt;
        uint256 extendedTime = maxDeadline - alreadyUsedTime - currentTime; // @audit The issue is in this line

        emit Log("Audit log");
    }   
}
```

### Mitigation

Remove unused calculation
