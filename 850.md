# Potential out-of-Bound access error

### Summary

The loop in the `getHistoricalBuyOrder` function is iterating up to offset+limit, when the _historicalBuyOrders is of length is `limit-offset`, it may lead to a potential issue.
Similar behaviour is also found in `getActiveBuyOrders`  of buyOrderFactory.sol

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L139-L177

The functions getActiveBuyOrders and getHistoricalBuyOrders exhibit two critical issues in their implementation:

**Mismatched array lengths and iteration ranges.**

- The arrays _historicalBuyOrders and _activeBuyOrders are initialized with a length of limit - offset.
- However, the for loop iterates from offset to offset + limit, effectively requiring an array length of limit, not limit - offset

**Incorrect indexing during the population of the arrays, leading to potential empty slots.**

- Within the loop, the assignment statements _activeBuyOrders[i] = BuyOrder(order).getBuyInfo(); and _historicalBuyOrders[i] = BuyOrder(order).getBuyInfo(); directly use i as the index.
- Since i starts from offset, the indices from 0 to offset - 1 in the arrays remain uninitialized, leading to incorrect results or potential undefined behavior.

### Attack Path

### Impact

**Runtime Exceptions**

Iterating beyond the bounds of dynamically allocated memory results in an out-of-bounds access, which will cause a contract call to revert.

**Incorrect Data**

Due to the wrong index calculation in the assignment, the resulting arrays may have uninitialized elements or unexpected empty slots.

**Increased Gas Costs**

The incorrect implementation may unnecessarily allocate and iterate over memory, leading to inefficient gas usage. 

### PoC

```solidity
function getActiveBuyOrders(
    uint offset,
    uint limit
) public view returns (BuyOrder.BuyInfo[] memory) {
    uint length = limit;
    if (limit > activeOrdersCount) {
        length = activeOrdersCount;
    }

    BuyOrder.BuyInfo[] memory _activeBuyOrders = new BuyOrder.BuyInfo[](length - offset);

    for (uint i = offset; i < length; i++) {
        address order = allActiveBuyOrders[i];
        _activeBuyOrders[i - offset] = BuyOrder(order).getBuyInfo();
    }

    return _activeBuyOrders;
}

```
Similar changes to getHistoricalBuyOrder potentially solves the issue
