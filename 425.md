# veNFTs kept as collateral might be lost forever if `safeTransferFrom` is not implemented in the protocol

### Summary

Not using the `safeTransferFrom` when transferring `ERC721` veNFTs might cause the veNFT to be lost forever if the receiver cannot handle `ERC721` tokens. 

### Root Cause

There are 2 possible situations with the same root cause: 
1. If a borrower keeps their veNFT as collateral and fails to pay off the loan, the lender reserves the right to take the [collateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L403). The protocol uses the `transferFrom` function instead of the `safeTransferFrom` function to transfer the veNFT collateral from the Loan contract to the lender's address. 
2. If an veNFT enters an auction and a buyer is interested to buy the veNFT, the veNFT has a possibility of being lost [forever](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L149). 

The `transferFrom` function does not check if the recipient can handle the ERC721 tokens. If the lender can not handle the ERC721 tokens, the veNFT will be lost forever. 

On the other hand the `safeTransferFrom` function includes additional checks to ensure that the recipient can accept ERC721 tokens. 

### Internal pre-conditions

### Scenario 1
1. Borrower creates a borrow order with an veNFT as collateral. 
2. Borrower gets paired with a lender that cannot accept veNFTs. 
3. Borrower does not pay the loan off. 
4. Lender tries to collect the collateral but never receives it. 

### Scenario 2
1. A veNFT is held in auction. 
2. Buyer buys the veNFT. 
3. Buyer never receives the veNFT.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This will impact the lenders who cannot accept `ERC721` tokens. This will lead to a **100%** loss of funds for the lender. They will lose all of the tokens they lent to the borrower, plus the collateral they tried to collect.

### Mitigation

Please use OpenZeppelin's `safeTransferFrom` function to transfer `ERC721` tokens.
