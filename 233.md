# Incorrect parameter in `incentivizePair` function causes data corruption in `bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch` mapping

### Summary

The `incentivizePair` function in the `DebitaIncentives` contract incorrectly increments the `bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch` mapping using the `incentivizeToken` as the key instead of the `principle`. This error causes data corruption by mismanaging the count of bribes associated with each principle for a given epoch. As a result, functions that rely on this mapping, such as `getBribesPerEpoch`, will return incorrect data or fail. This issue impacts the accuracy of incentive distribution and can disrupt the protocol's functionality.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from using the wrong key (`incentivizeToken`) instead of the correct key (`principle`) to increment the `bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch` mapping in the `incentivizePair` function. Specifically, the code:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L264
```solidity
bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch[epoch][incentivizeToken]++;
```

was intended to increment the count of bribes associated with a `principle` for a specific `epoch`. However, it mistakenly uses `incentivizeToken` as the key, leading to corruption of the mapping and mismanagement of the bribe count. This results in indexing errors and incorrect incentive tracking for principles.

### Attack Path

1. **Incentivize a Pair**: An attacker or user calls `incentivizePair` with valid parameters, but multiple distinct `incentivizeToken` values for the same `principle`.

2. **Exploit Incorrect Key Usage**: The incorrect key (`incentivizeToken`) is used to increment `bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch`, leading to overlapping or mismatched bribe counts for the `principle`.

3. **Corrupt Data Retrieval**:
   - Functions like `getBribesPerEpoch` will retrieve incorrect or incomplete data due to the corrupted `bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch`.
   - The protocol fails to associate the correct number of bribes with the `principle`.

4. **System Disruption**:
   - Incentive distribution for the affected `principle` becomes unreliable.
   - Users or attackers may exploit the corrupted data to claim incorrect or unintended incentives. 

This attack path exploits the incorrect parameter usage to disrupt incentive tracking, causing significant operational issues in the protocol.

### Impact

The incorrect use of `incentivizeToken` instead of `principle` in the `incentivizePair` function's `bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch` mapping results in the following impacts:

1. **Data Corruption**:
   - The mapping `bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch` is corrupted, associating bribe counts with `incentivizeToken` instead of the intended `principle`.
   - Subsequent functions relying on this mapping, such as `getBribesPerEpoch`, will return incorrect or incomplete data.

2. **Inaccurate Incentive Tracking**:
   - The protocol cannot correctly track the number of bribes associated with each principle for a specific epoch.
   - This disrupts the incentive distribution process, causing users to receive incorrect bribes or miss their entitled incentives.

3. **System Disruption**:
   - Incentive distribution becomes unreliable, undermining the protocol's functionality and user trust.
   - Users may receive incentives meant for others or claim invalid incentives, leading to potential financial loss for the protocol.

4. **Potential Exploitation**:
   - Malicious actors could intentionally exploit this flaw to mismanage bribes, causing operational and reputational damage to the protocol.

5. **Reputation Damage**:
   - The protocol's reliability and trustworthiness are compromised, leading to reduced user confidence and participation.

This issue significantly affects the protocol's ability to manage and distribute incentives accurately, resulting in operational inefficiencies and potential financial losses.

### Mitigation

   Replace:
   ```solidity
   bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch[epoch][incentivizeToken]++;
   ```
   with:
   ```solidity
   bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch[epoch][principle]++;
   ```
