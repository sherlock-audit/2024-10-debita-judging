# Auction can not work well with TaxTokensReceipt because of TaxTokensReceipt's transfer limitation

### Summary

TaxTokensReceipt NFT has transfer limitation. This will block TaxTokensReceipt NFT transferred from auction contract to the buyer.

### Root Cause

In [TaxTokensReceipt:transferFrom](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L93), there is one transfer limitation.
If both `from` and `to` addresses don't belong to borrow order, lend order or loan, the receipt NFT cannot be transferred.
The problem is that auctions are not in the whitelist. So in auction, when buyers want to buy one NFT from one auction to his own address, this will be reverted because both `from` and `to` addresses are not in the whitelist of TaxTokensReceipts.
```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public virtual override(ERC721, IERC721) {
        bool isReceiverAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory).isBorrowOrderLegit(to) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(to) ||
IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(to);
        bool isSenderAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory).isBorrowOrderLegit(from) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(from) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(from);
        require(
            isReceiverAddressDebita || isSenderAddressDebita,
            "TaxTokensReceipts: Debita not involved"
        );
        ...
}
```
```solidity
    function buyNFT() public onlyActiveAuction {
        Token.safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            msg.sender,
            s_CurrentAuction.nftCollateralID
        );
    }
```

### Impact

Auction cannot work with TaxTokensReceipt. If borrowers use TaxTokensReceipt as collateral, and borrowers don't pay the debt timely, lenders or the borrower starts one auction for this receipt. This receipt NFT will be locked forever.

### Mitigation

Add auction list into the TaxTokensReceipt's whitelist.
