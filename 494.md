# Redundant Initialization in `changeOwner`

### Summary

The redundant statement `owner = owner;` in the `changeOwner` function has no functional impact but increases code confusion and bloats the contract unnecessarily.  

The redundant initialization `owner = owner` will cause no actual state change for the protocol owner, as this line is effectively a no-operation. It introduces unnecessary complexity for developers reviewing or auditing the contract.  

### Root Cause

In  buyOrderFactory:186 ( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186 ) , the statement `owner = owner;` has no effect because it reassigns the variable to its current value, leading to dead code.  

Example:  
- The line `owner = owner;` performs no meaningful action.  

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `changeOwner` function is called.  

### External pre-conditions

No external conditions are required for this issue to manifest, as it is a code inefficiency rather than an exploitable vulnerability.  

### Attack Path

No direct attack path exists for this issue.  

### Impact

Permanent inability to transfer ownership
Risk of protocol being locked if original owner loses access
No way to update critical protocol parameters that require owner access
Potential need for contract redeployment to fix ownership issues

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    require(_newOwner != address(0), "Zero address");
    owner = _newOwner; // Fixed assignment
}
