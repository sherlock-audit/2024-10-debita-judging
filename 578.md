# Using `transferFrom` instead of `safetransferFrom` in `DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol::cancelOffer()` at #L200.

### Summary

In the code line -
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L200

```js
    IERC721(m_borrowInformation.collateral).transferFrom(
        address(this),
        msg.sender,
        m_borrowInformation.receiptID
    );
```
We are unaware wheather the owner/`msg.sender` is an EOA or contract, or if it's contract we don't know wheather it can handle ERC721 or not. so it's unsafe to use `transferFrom` as it doesn;t check whether the transfer of NFT is succesful or not.
