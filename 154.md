# Lenders or borrowers may fail to claim collateral after the auction is finished

### Summary

If the receipt's underlying token is fee-on-transfer token, borrowers or lenders may fail to claim collateral because of the lack of fee-on-transfer process.

### Root Cause

In readme, it mentions that `Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in TaxTokensReceipt contract`. If we deposit fee-on-transfer token into one receipt, borrowers can use this receipt to create one borrow order. After we match this borrow order with some lend orders, borrowers can borrow some principles based on the receipt collateral.
If borrowers fail to pay the debt timely, the borrower or lenders can choose to start one [auction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L470) for this receipt.
When we create this auction, we will find the underlying token for this receipt via interface [getDataByReceipt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L122). If this receipt's underlying token is fee-on-transfer token, it means that this auction's `sellingToken` is fee-on-transfer token.
When one buyer buys this receipt, the buyer will transfer `currentPrice - feeAmount` fee-on-transfer token to the related loan contract and the auction will handle the received selling token via [handleAuctionSell()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L318). The problem is that the `amount` in handleAuctionSell() is not the actual received amount. This will cause that `tokenPerCollateralUsed` calculated will be larger than the actual `tokenPerCollateralUsed`. Left borrowers or lenders may fail to claim their collateral after some borrowers or lenders claim one part of the selling token. Because there is not enough balance in the loan contract.

```solidity
function createAuctionForCollateral(
    uint indexOfLender
) external nonReentrant {
        IveNFTEqualizer.receiptInstance memory receiptInfo = IveNFTEqualizer(
            m_loan.collateral
        ).getDataByReceipt(m_loan.NftID);
        ...
        address liveAuction = auctionFactory.createAuction(
            m_loan.NftID,
            m_loan.collateral,
            receiptInfo.underlying, // Here the auction token is ERC721 NFT's underlying token, For exampe, aero token.
            receiptInfo.lockedAmount,
            floorAmount,
            864000 // 86400 --> 1 day, 864000 --> 10 days
        );

}
```
```solidity
    function buyNFT() public onlyActiveAuction {
            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
            msg.sender,
            s_ownerOfAuction,
            currentPrice - feeAmount
        );
        ...
        if (m_currentAuction.isLiquidation) {
            // We need to let the Loan know how many tokens this NFT is selled.
            debitaLoan(s_ownerOfAuction).handleAuctionSell(
                currentPrice - feeAmount
            );
        }
}
```
```solidity
    function handleAuctionSell(uint amount) external nonReentrant {
        require(
            msg.sender == auctionData.auctionAddress,
            "Not auction contract"
        );
        require(auctionData.alreadySold == false, "Already sold");
        LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
        IveNFTEqualizer.receiptInstance memory nftData = IveNFTEqualizer(
            m_loan.collateral
        ).getDataByReceipt(m_loan.NftID);
        uint PRECISION = 10 ** nftData.decimals; // Here the decimal is the underlying token(AERO)'s decimal
        auctionData.soldAmount = amount;
        auctionData.alreadySold = true;
        auctionData.tokenPerCollateralUsed = ((amount * PRECISION) /
            (loanData.valuableCollateralUsed)); // valuableCollateralUsed means that in this loan the collateral amount that all lender orders take.
        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));
    }

```


### Internal pre-conditions

1. This TaxTokensReceipt is based on the fee-on-transfer token.
2. One receipt is taken as the borrow collateral and the borrower fails to pay debt timely. Lenders or borrower start one auction for this receipt.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Left borrower or lenders fail to claim collateral if fee-on-transfer receipt is sold via auction.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Considering that possible fee-on-transfer selling token, when we update auction sell via `handleAuctionSell`, we can use `IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken).balanceOf(s_ownerOfAuction)`.
