# Active Order Count Manipulation Through Multiple Cancellations

### Summary

Malicious users can manipulate the `activeOrdersCount` in the `DebitaLendOfferFactory` contract by exploiting a flaw in the interaction between cancelOffer() and addFunds() functions. The ability to call addFunds on a canceled lend offer will cause a logical flaw that allows repeated calls to cancelOffer. This reduces the activeOrdersCount to zero, resulting in underflow issues. The underflow creates two significant problems:
1. Other lenders cannot cancel their offers.
2. Matching lending offers in acceptLendingOffer fails when all available amounts used


### Root Cause

The root cause stems from two key design flaws:
1. The cancelOffer() function in `DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol `sets isActive = false but doesn't prevent subsequent calls to addFunds()
2. The addFunds() function only checks for owner or loan sender permissions but doesn't verify the offer's active status

```solidity
    function cancelOffer() public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        uint availableAmount = lendInformation.availableAmount;
        lendInformation.perpetual = false;
        lendInformation.availableAmount = 0;
        require(availableAmount > 0, "No funds to cancel");
        isActive = false;

        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            availableAmount
        );
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
        // emit canceled event on factory
    }
```

This allows a malicious user to:
- Cancel an offer (decreasing activeOrdersCount)
 - Add new funds to the cancelled offer
- Cancel again (further decreasing activeOrdersCount)
- Repeat until activeOrdersCount is 0


```solidity
function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder {
    ...
    activeOrdersCount--;
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Attacker must be the owner of a lending offer
2. The lending offer must have been successfully created through the factory
3. The offer must have available funds to cancel initially
4. The attacker must have additional funds to add after cancellation

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user creates a lend offer and cancels it by calling cancelOffer, which reduces activeOrdersCount via deleteOrder.
2. The user adds funds to the canceled offer using addFunds.
3. The user repeats step 1, reducing activeOrdersCount further with each cycle.
4. When activeOrdersCount underflows:
- Other lenders are unable to cancel their offers.
- Matching offers in acceptLendingOffer fails.

### Impact

Other Lenders unable to cancel their offers due to the underflow in activeOrdersCount.
acceptLendingOffer() also calls deleteOrder() when an offer's availableAmount is 0. This prevents new lending matches from being processed

### PoC

Inside PerpetualMixPrinciples.t.sol test file

```solidity
    function testOrderCountUnderflow() public {
       assertEq(
            DLOFactoryContract.activeOrdersCount(),3);
            
        vm.startPrank(secondLender);
        wETHContract.approve(address(SecondLendOrder), 5e18);
        SecondLendOrder.cancelOffer();
        SecondLendOrder.addFunds(10);

        SecondLendOrder.cancelOffer();
        SecondLendOrder.addFunds(10);
        SecondLendOrder.cancelOffer();
        SecondLendOrder.addFunds(10);
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(
            DLOFactoryContract.activeOrdersCount(),0);

        //@audit lender cant cancel because of underflow
        vm.startPrank(thirdLender);
        ThirdLendOrder.cancelOffer();

    }
```

### Mitigation

Prevent calls to addFunds() when offer is not active

```solidity
    function addFunds(uint amount) public nonReentrant {
+  require(isActive, "Offer is not active");

```
