# lender will incur loss when the borrower repays too early

### Summary

there exists no min time limit for a borrower to repay the debt. if the borrower calls repay quickly after the loan is signed this may incur a loss of funds for the lender. the lender has to pay the following fee

            uint feeToPay = (amountPerPrinciple[i] * percentage) / 10000;
now consider a scenario 

Amount: 3000
fee Percentage: 80 (0.80%)
loan duration 4 months
interest = 10%  

3000×80=240000
240000÷10000=24


For an amount of 3000 and a percentage of 80, the fee to pay is 24 units.



the interest to pay on debt is calculated as

    function calculateInterestToPay(uint index) public view returns (uint) {
        infoOfOffers memory offer = loanData._acceptedOffers[index];
        uint anualInterest = (offer.principleAmount * offer.apr) / 10000;
        // check already duration
        uint activeTime = block.timestamp - loanData.startedAt;
        uint minimalDurationPayment = (loanData.initialDuration * 1000) / 10000;
        uint maxDuration = offer.maxDeadline - loanData.startedAt;
        if (activeTime > maxDuration) {
            activeTime = maxDuration;
        } else if (activeTime < minimalDurationPayment) {
            activeTime = minimalDurationPayment;
        }


        uint interest = (anualInterest * activeTime) / 31536000;


        // subtract already paid interest
        return interest - offer.interestPaid;
    }

the borrower is subjected to pay a interest of minimal duration even if he repays early however this does not protect the lender from incurring a loss completely


Parameters:

Annual Interest (APR): 10%
Loan Duration: 4 months
Active Time: 10% of 4 months (calculated in seconds)
10% of 4 months = 1,051,200 seconds (12 days)

Interest for 12 days:
uint anualInterest = (offer.principleAmount * offer.apr) / 10000;

3000×1000=3000000
3000000/10000 = 300
annual interest = 300

uint interest = (anualInterest * activeTime) / 31536000;
uint interest = (300 * 1036800) / 31536000;
uint interest = 311040000 / 31536000; = 9.86

the calculated interest is = 9.86; which rounds to 9




the protocol also charges a 15% fee on interest from the lender

    uint public feeInterestLender = 1500; // 15% of the paid interest

            uint feeOnInterest = (interest * feeLender) / 10000;

So, the feeOnInterest 1.35 15%of interest amount

 9- 1 = 8


total loss for the lender = 24 - 8 = 16

which is more than 0.1% of 3000 this makes this issue valid as per sherlock rules




### Root Cause

the borrower can repay the loan whenever he wishes to

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

the borrower will also pay the interest amount to the lender which makes this non profitable for the borrower however the borrower can still execute this for the following reasons

1.If the borrower’s collateral has significantly appreciated in value, they may be incentivized to repay the loan early and take out a new loan based on the increased value of the collateral. This would allow the borrower to borrow more for the same amount of collateral, taking advantage of the new collateral value. In this case, the borrower is not incurring a significant penalty, and the lender faces a potential loss due to early repayment

2.After reaching the minimal duration (10% of the loan duration), the borrower may no longer need the borrowed principal and may wish to repay early. However, the lender still faces the risk of not recovering the expected fees because the loan duration is shorter than anticipated.

3.The borrower may find a better offer in the market and choose to repay early in order to take advantage of that new offer. This could happen if the borrower is able to repay without incurring significant penalties

4.the borrower can select a loan duration that is longer than their actual needs, as long as it is within the maximum duration allowed by the lending offers. However, whether the borrower can repay the loan early Example: If the borrower needs a loan for 10 days but the lender allows a max loan duration of 30 days, the borrower could choose to borrow for the full 30 days


### Impact

loss of funds for the lender

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

the protocol can choose to penalize the the borrower for early repayment or implement a min duration check to make sure the interest is sufficient to cover the fee paid by the lender
