# Missing check of lend offer active state when calling addFunds method.

### Summary

DLOImplementation::addFunds method is used to addFunds ether from paying debt/interests in DebitaV3Loan or directly from lend offer owner. When calling this method, isActive state should be checked.

### Root Cause

DLOImplementation::addFunds function is for add funds to lend offer. The funds may ether from payed debt/interests or from the lender owner. However when the lender is fulfilled and perpetual is set to false, the lender offer will be deleted from factory contract, in the situation, isActive is set to false. addFunds function should not permit funds extending in such cases.

+      require(isActive,  "offer is not active");
        require(
            msg.sender == lendInformation.owner ||
                IAggregator(aggregatorContract).isSenderALoan(msg.sender),
            "Only owner or loan"
        );
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        lendInformation.availableAmount += amount;
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
