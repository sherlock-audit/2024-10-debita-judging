# Logic of `changeOwner` won't update the owner of `AuctionFactory`

### Summary

The function [changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218-L222) would not allow the `owner` to transfer their ownership, due to the passed in parameter having the exact same name as the state variable, and the first check being executed against that same parameter.

### Root Cause

- In function [changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218-L222) the parameter is with the exact same name as the state variable owner
- The first [require](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L219) statement in `changeOwner` will get executed against the passed owner as an argument, instead of the state variable.


### Internal pre-conditions

The owner of [AuctionFactory](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol) has to call [changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218-L222)

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. The owner of DebitaV3Aggregator calls changeOwner with the address of the new owner.
2. The call reverts due to msg.sender not being equal to owner the parameter.
3. The owner calls the function again, with their address passed as an argument and the call is successful, however, the owner state variable wasn't updated at all, due to the new address being their own address once again.


### Impact

The owner of each auction can't be changed, preventing the following functions from being called: `setFloorPriceForLiquidations, changeAuctionFee, changePublicAuctionFee, setAggregator, setFeeAddress`

### PoC

In Auction.t.sol add the following:

Firstly, import the console with:
`import "forge-std/console2.sol";`

Secondly, add this getter function in `AuctionFactory.sol`:
```solidity
    function getOwner() public view returns (address) {
        return owner;
    }
```

Then, add the following test:
```solidity

    function testChangeFactoryOwner() public {
        address newOwner = makeAddr("newOwner");

        // assert that this contract is the owner of the contract `DebitaV3Aggregator`
        assertEq(address(this), factory.getOwner());
        // attempt to change owner, but call reverts
        console2.log("attempt to change owner, but call reverts");
        vm.expectRevert();
        factory.changeOwner(newOwner);
        console2.log("call is successful, but owner is not updated");
        factory.changeOwner(address(this));

        // the newOwner was never set and the original owner remains the owner
        assertNotEq(newOwner, factory.getOwner());
        assertEq(address(this), factory.getOwner());
    }

```
