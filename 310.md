# Incorrect Handling of owner Parameter in `changeOwner` Function

## Summary
The `changeOwner` function, as implemented in `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol`, `AuctionFactory.sol`, and `BuyOrderFactory.sol`, fails to update the contract's actual owner due to a naming conflict between the function parameter and the state variable. This bug causes the function to behave incorrectly, leading to a failure in ownership transfer.

## Vulnerability Details
## Root Cause:
The function parameter owner shadows the state variable owner. When assigning the new owner, owner = owner, the function assigns the value of the parameter owner to itself rather than updating the state variable. Consequently, the actual state variable owner remains unchanged.

## Behavior of the Bug:

The first require statement `(require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");)` checks the new owner's address instead of the current owner's address. If the actual owner attempts to call this function, it reverts because `msg.sender` will never match the new owner's address.
Even if the function were executed without the revert, the state variable owner would not be updated, as the assignment affects only the function-scoped parameter.

## Code Snippet
[AuctionFactory.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218-L222)

[DebitaV3Aggregator.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682-L686)

[buyOrderFactory.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L185-L190)

``` javascript
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```
## Impact
Ownership cannot be transferred. This issue locks critical administrative functions and halts any further development or updates that rely on ownership changes.

## POC
Enter this line into your terminal .
```solidity
 forge test --mt testchangeowner -vvvv
```
Add deployedtime variable and initalize it in your setup function with block.timestamp . Add this test case to BasicDebitaAggregator.t.sol .

```javascript
   
       uint deployedtime ;
   function testchangeowner() public {
        // The previous owner of contract is owner1.
        address owner1 = DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner();
        address owner2 = address(0x08);
        console.log("Old Owner of the contract is", owner1);
        console.log("Owner want to change their role with ", owner2);
        vm.warp(deployedtime + 7 hours);
    //   Only new  owner can call changeOwner .
        vm.startPrank(owner2);
        DebitaV3AggregatorContract.changeOwner(owner2);
       console.log("New Owner of the contract is", DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner());
    // The actual owner of the contract is not changed
        assertEq(owner1 , DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner());
    }
``` 
## Recommendation
Rename the owner parameter in the `changeOwner` function to a distinct name (e.g., _owner) to avoid shadowing the state variable:
```solidity
function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner"); // Verify current owner
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = _owner; // Update state variable with new owner
}
```
