# Potential Denial of Service due to improper initialization in `DBOImplementation`

### Summary

A vulnerability exists in the `DBOImplementation` contract where a malicious user can manipulate the initialization process to set themselves as the owner of the contract, thereby preventing any subsequent legitimate borrow orders from being created. The malicious user can exploit the `initializer` modifier, which prevents reinitialization, leading to a denial of service (DoS) for the contract's intended functionality.

### Root Cause

The `initialize` function in the `DBOImplementation` contract uses the `initializer` modifier to prevent multiple initializations, but it does not properly check or restrict who can initialize the contract.
If the `initialize` function is called by a malicious actor (e.g., the attacker) before the legitimate initialization by the `DBOFactory`, the contract will become effectively "locked" and unusable for new borrow orders.

### Attack Path

1. **Malicious User Interaction:**

The attacker interacts directly with the `DBOImplementation` contract and calls the `initialize` function.
The attacker sets themselves as the owner during initialization.
This is possible because the `initialize` function does not properly restrict access or check if the contract has already been initialized by a legitimate source (e.g., the `DBOFactory` contract).

2. **Borrower Interaction**:

A legitimate borrower attempts to create a new borrow order via the `DBOFactory` contract.
The `DBOFactory` contract calls the `initialize` function on a newly created `DBOImplementation` contract (as part of the borrow order creation process).
The `initialize` function reverts because it has already been called once by the malicious user, triggering the `initializer` modifier's reversion condition.

3. **Denial of Service (DoS)**:

The `initialize` function cannot be called again, leading to the failure of the borrow order creation process.
The borrower cannot create new borrow orders, effectively breaking the contract's functionality.

### Impact

**Denial of Service (DoS):** The ability to prevent legitimate users from creating borrow orders via the DBOFactory contract.

**System Instability**: New borrow orders cannot be initiated, halting the core functionality of the lending protocol.

**Loss of Service**: The malicious user effectively disables the contract's ability to handle new borrow orders by setting themselves as the owner and locking the initialization process.

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, the `DBOImplementation` contract can use a constructor to disable `initializers` for the implementation contract itself. This prevents the implementation contract from being initialized, while still allowing newly deployed instances to function as intended. Add the following constructor to the implementation contract:

```solidity

constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```
This ensures that the initialize function in the implementation contract cannot be called directly, mitigating the denial-of-service attack vector.
