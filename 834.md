# External calls without failure checks in acceptBorrowOffer function

### Summary

The acceptBorrowOffer function does not verify the success of external calls during collateral transfers. This could leave the contract in an inconsistent state if a transfer fails, potentially resulting in locked collateral or incorrect accounting.

### Root Cause

The function modifies the borrowInformation.availableAmount state before executing external calls (IERC721.transferFrom or SafeERC20.safeTransfer) without validating their success. If these calls fail due to issues such as insufficient balance, approval errors, or paused tokens, the contract state will remain inconsistent.

### Internal pre-conditions

1) borrowInformation.availableAmount is modified prior to the external calls.
2) No success check (require) is performed after the transfer operation.

### External pre-conditions

The transfer operation may fail due to:
- Insufficient token balance.
- Lack of approval for ERC-20/ERC-721 tokens.
- Token contract being paused or restricted.

### Attack Path

1) A borrower initiates a transfer with insufficient token balance or approval.
2) The external call fails silently.
3) The borrowInformation.availableAmount and other state variables are already updated, leading to:
- Discrepancies in available collateral.
- Invalid assumptions for further transactions (e.g., over-transferring collateral).

### Impact

- Inconsistent Contract State: State variables reflect an incorrect state if transfers fail.
- Locked Collateral: Collateral may remain inaccessible, disrupting the contract's operation.

### Mitigation

Add Success Checks: Validate external calls to ensure transfers succeed. For example: 
bool success = IERC721(m_borrowInformation.collateral).transferFrom(
    address(this), aggregatorContract, m_borrowInformation.receiptID
);  
require(success, "Transfer failed"); 

Similarly, validate ERC-20 transfers by using require.
