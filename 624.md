# Owner of lend offer can delete the offer more than once, completely messing up DLOFactoryâ€™s storage

### Summary

Missing check for deleted offer in [DLOImplementation::addFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162-L176), will cause the existing lend offers stored in the contract DLOFactory to be overwritten, as the owner of an already deleted lend offer, will repeatedly add funds and then cancel it, causing it to be deleted again and again. 

The repeated deletion of the offer in the [DLOFactory::deleteOffer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207-L220), will [reduce the activeOrdersCount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L219) state variable by 1 on each deletion. Since [activeOrdersCount acts as the ID of the offer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L187-L189) when it is created, deliberately reducing it will overwrite existing offers when new offers will be created. Even without creating new offers, the important view function [DLOFactory::getActiveOrders](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L222-L243), will eventually [underflow as activeOrdersCount will reach zero](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L235), effectively deleting all existing active offers.

Note that DLOFactory::getActiveOrders is the primary and intended way of retrieving active offers, so that they can be used as [input arguments to the matching function DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L275).

### Root Cause

In [DLOImplementation::addFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162-L176) there is a missing check if the order has already been deleted once.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A permissionless user needs to call [DLOFactory::createLendOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L124-L203) to create a new lend offer.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. The owner of the lend order will call [DLOImplementation::cancelOffer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L144-L159).
2. The owner of the lend order will call [DLOImplementation::addFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162-L176).
3. The owner of the lend order will call [DLOImplementation::cancelOffer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L144-L159).
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until activeOrdersCount reaches 0.

### Impact

Off-chain entities, such as permissionless users or bots, will not be able retrieve correct on-chain data about the active lend offers.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check in [DLOImplementation::addFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162-L176):

```solidity
require(isActive)
```

This will make sure that the lend order owner will not be able to add funds to an already deleted offer. [DLOImplementation::cancelOffer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L144-L159) and [DLOImplementation::acceptLendingOffer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L109-L139), which both can call [DLOFactory::deleteOffer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207-L220), will revert if the availableAmount is zero.
