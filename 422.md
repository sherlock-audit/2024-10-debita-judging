# Lack of change owner functional implementation in some contracts

### Summary

The `DebitaLoanOwnerships`, `DebitaV3Aggregator`, `DebitaPyth`, `DebitaChainlink`, `AuctionFactory`, `BuyOrderFactory` contracts have functionality to change the [contract owner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682), while the `DBOFactory`, `DLOFactory`, `DebitaIncentives` contracts do not have this functionality.

And if in `DBOFactory` and `DLOFactory` contracts it can be considered as designChoice, because owner sets only one parameter there and that once. But in the `DebitaIncentives` contract the owner controls the functions `deprecatePrinciple`, `whitelListCollateral`. 
Thus, the lack of owner change functionality in this contract is an issue, because other contracts implement this functionality.

### Root Cause

Contracts `DBOFactory`, `DLOFactory`, `DebitaIncentives` doesnt support owner change functionality in contrast to other contracts of the protocol. 

### Internal pre-conditions

If other contracts change owner for any reason - for example the address of the previous owner will be compromised. This will not be possible in the above contracts.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

No special attack path

### Impact

The protocol loses key functionality in some contracts while it is present in others.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add change owner functional to contracts that missed it
