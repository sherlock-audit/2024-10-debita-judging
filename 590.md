# Everyone can set themselves as an `owner`

### Summary

The function that sets the owner uses the same name for the function parameter, as well as the storage variable.

It checks the `msg.senger` against the `owner`, but the `owner` is not the storage variable (the current owner actually),
 but the function parameter being passed.

This means that **anyone** can set themselves as an `owner` due to the function parameter being closed to scope than the storage variable.

### Root Cause

The root cause is plain and simple - we should NOT have the same names for the param in `AuctionFactory::changeOwner()` as well as in `DebitaV3Aggregator::changeOwner()`, because the variable that is closer in scope is going to take precedence - in this case: the function param that is an user input and NOT the storage variable, thus bypassing the require statement that checks the `msg.sender` against the `owner`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `changeOwner()` passing the same address of his account and gains access to the functions that are reserved for owner only

### Impact

In `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol`, user can set the max & min fee, can set a new fee, can enable or disable oracles as he wishes.

In `AuctionFactory.sol`, user can set the floor price for liquidations, lower or higher depending on what he wants,
 he can change the auction fee, the public auction fee, change the address from the aggregator contract to another address via `setAggregator()` which is used for checking if the sender is a loan in ` IAggregator(aggregator).isSenderALoan(msg.sender)`.

Basically compromising the integrity of the application and ruining users' trust in it.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Differentiate the function param name with the storage variable name, because if they are the same, the function will take the one that is closer in scope - the function param.
