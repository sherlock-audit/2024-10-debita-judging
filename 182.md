# (REMOVED OUT OF SCOPE) In `BuyOrderFactory.sol`, multiple problems with `getActiveBuyOrders()` and `getHistoricalBuyOrders()` will cause calls to revert

### Summary

Calls with `getActiveBuyOrders()` and `getHistoricalBuyOrders()` in `BuyOrderFactory.sol` fail to cap `limit` and `offset` to array length.
When both function read out of bound array value, it just revert the transaction.

Under several specific conditions below, it is very common operation to revert.

### Root Cause


See "@@" code comments

```solidity
    function getActiveBuyOrders(
        uint offset,
        uint limit//@limit is actual array index limit huh
    ) public view returns (BuyOrder.BuyInfo[] memory) {
        uint length = limit;

        if (limit > activeOrdersCount) {
            length = activeOrdersCount;
        }//@Root 1: cap limit to array length. But `length` value never used.

        BuyOrder.BuyInfo[] memory _activeBuyOrders = new BuyOrder.BuyInfo[](
            limit - offset
        );
        for (uint i = offset; i < offset + limit; i++) { //@Root 2: offset + limit will overshoot activeOrdersCount
            address order = allActiveBuyOrders[i];//@reading out of bound index will just revert
            _activeBuyOrders[i] = BuyOrder(order).getBuyInfo();//@Root 3: i == offset. the array start from 0. So if offset >0, it will set value out of bounds.
        }//@.getBuyInfo() will revert too because it try to read address(0)
        return _activeBuyOrders;
    }
```

The above buggy code look like it was copy from [other contracts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L166-L185) then modified, but the modification is not complete.


### Internal pre-conditions


Example:
We have an active order count of 5.

### External pre-conditions


Someone cancel order, total active order count is 4. array[4] is removed and return empty value.


### Attack Path


- `getActiveBuyOrders(0, 5)` will read read array[4] with zero address value. zero address always fail when call `getBuyInfo()`
- request `getHistoricalAuctions(0, 5)` will read out of bound array and revert.
- With offset, `getActiveBuyOrders(3, 5)` will also revert.

### Impact


If someone just cancel order. Any request to read all active orders with wrong array length will revert.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


```solidity
    function getActiveBuyOrders(
        uint offset,
        uint limit //@limit is actually limit of return array now
    ) public view returns (BuyOrder.BuyInfo[] memory) {
        if(offset > activeOrdersCount){
            return new BuyOrder.BuyInfo[](0);
        }
        else if (offset + limit > activeOrdersCount) {
            limit = activeOrdersCount - offset;
        }

        BuyOrder.BuyInfo[] memory _activeBuyOrders = new BuyOrder.BuyInfo[](
            limit
        );//return array length = limit count
        for (uint i = 0; i < limit; i++) { 
            address order = allActiveBuyOrders[i + offset];
            _activeBuyOrders[i] = BuyOrder(order).getBuyInfo();
        }
        return _activeBuyOrders;
    }
