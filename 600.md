# Mixing of PriceFeed decimals could break protocol core functionalities

### Summary

A decimal precision mismatch between the price feeds used in the ``matchOrder`` contract can lead to incorrect calculations of borrower-to-principle ratios. Specifically, the issue arises in the ``getPriceFrom`` function when fetching prices from oracles with inconsistent decimal precision, such as Chainlink oracles that vary between 8 and 18 decimals. This inconsistency propagates through critical calculations in the matchOrder contract, leading to inaccurate loan terms, potential protocol insolvency, and failed transactions.

The issue of inconsistent decimal precision from the ``getPriceFrom`` function directly impacts the calculation of loan-to-value ratios (``LTV``) . If oracles return prices with different decimal precisions and the logic does not properly account for these differences, it can cause incorrect ratios. 

### Root Cause

The ``getThePrice`` function mistakenly assumes that all Chainlink price feeds have the same decimal precision. While most USD price feeds use 8 decimals, some, like the ``AMPL/USD`` feed, use 18 decimals.

```solidity
   function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
     @>   return price;
    }
```
The ``matchOrder`` contract fetches collateral and principle prices using the ``getPriceFrom`` function, relying on oracles provided by the borrower. For example:

```solidity
uint priceCollateral_BorrowOrder = getPriceFrom(
    borrowInfo.oracle_Collateral,
    borrowInfo.valuableAsset
);
uint pricePrinciple = getPriceFrom(
    borrowInfo.oracles_Principles[indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder[i]],
    principles[i]
);
```
These prices are used to calculate the ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral:

```solidity
uint ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = (priceCollateral_BorrowOrder * 10 ** 8) / pricePrinciple;
```
The calculation assumes both ``priceCollateral_BorrowOrder`` and ``pricePrinciple`` have consistent decimal precision. However, if the oracles return prices with different decimals (e.g., 8 decimals for ``BTC/USD`` and 18 decimals for ``AMPL/USD``), the calculation produces incorrect results. This mismatch impacts the derived loan ratios and the borrower's borrowing capacity.

### Impact

1. **Underestimated Borrower Capacity**: Borrowers receive far fewer principle tokens than they should, leading to unfavorable loan terms and user dissatisfaction.
2. **Overestimated Borrower Capacity**: If the mismatch leads to an overestimation, borrowers could over-leverage, causing the protocol to become undercollateralized and risking insolvency during liquidations.
3. **Failed Transactions**: When the mismatch results in extreme values (e.g., pricePrinciple much larger than priceCollateral_BorrowOrder), the contract might:
Revert due to invalid price checks (``require(priceCollateral_BorrowOrder != 0)``).

### PoC

**Consider the following Setup**

- **Collateral**: BTC (borrowInfo.oracle_Collateral is a Chainlink oracle with 8 decimals).
- **Principle**: AMPL (borrowInfo.oracles_Principles is a Chainlink oracle with 18 decimals).
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**: 75% for AMPL as a principle.
- 
**Input Prices**
- ``priceCollateral_BorrowOrder`` = $$50,000 * 10⁸ (BTC/USD price from Chainlink oracle with 8 decimals).$$
- ``pricePrinciple`` = $$1,500 * 10¹⁸ (AMPL/USD price from Chainlink oracle with 18 decimals).$$

**Steps in Calculation**
Calculate Full LTV Value:

```solidity
ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = (priceCollateral_BorrowOrder * 10 ** 8) / pricePrinciple;
```
Substituting:
```math
(50,000 * 10⁸ * 10⁸) / (1,500 * 10¹⁸) = (50,000 * 10¹⁶) / (1,500 * 10¹⁸) = 0.0333.
```
- **Incorrect Result**: The mismatch in decimals drastically reduces the calculated value.
- **Corrected Calculation**: Normalize ``priceCollateral_BorrowOrder`` to 18 decimals:

$$priceCollateral_BorrowOrder = 50,000 * 10¹⁸.$$
**Recompute**:
```math
ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = (50,000 * 10¹⁸ * 10⁸) / (1,500 * 10¹⁸) = 33,333.33.
```
**Compute Loan Value: Using the incorrect value**:
$$value = (ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral * LTV) / 10000;$$
Substituting:

$$(0.0333 * 75) / 10000 = 0.0000024975.$$
**Correct Value**: $$(33,333.33 * 75) / 10000 = 2,500$$.


### Mitigation

Normalize price feed Decimal
```solidity

  uint8 decimals = IAggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed).decimals();
        if (decimals < 18) {
            return uint256(price) * 10**(18 - decimals); // Scale up to 18 decimals
        } else {
            return uint256(price) / 10**(decimals - 18); // Scale down to 18 decimals
        }
    }
```
