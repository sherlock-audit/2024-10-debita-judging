# `extendedTime` calculation in `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan` shall Cause denial of Service, due to overflow-underflow error.

### Summary

The `extendLoan` function in `DebitaV3Loan` contract contains a flawed calculation for `extendedTime` that causes arithmetic underflow, making the loan extension feature unusable for certain duration combinations. The double subtraction of `block.timestamp` in the calculation leads to arithmetic underflow.
The bug effectively creates a denial of service for loan extensions under common and valid loan scenarios, making it critical to fix.

### Root Cause

[In DebitaV3Loan.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L590) `extendedTime` calculation causes arithmetic errors leading to revert.


```Solidity 

uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;
uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - alreadyUsedTime - block.timestamp;

```

The extendedTime calculation is incorrect.
It subtracts the current timestamp twice:
- Once through alreadyUsedTime (which includes block.timestamp - startedAt)
- Again directly with block.timestamp

This creates a mathematical impossibility for many valid timestamp combinations, causing arithmetic underflow.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Borrower takes a 60-day loan with lenders offering 100 and 111-day max durations
- At day 55, borrower tries to extend the loan

### Impact

- Loan Extension fails due to arithmetic underflow
- Borrower loses ability to extend loan despite being within valid timeframes
- Could affect multiple loans with similar duration patterns
- The bug effectively creates a denial of service for loan extensions under common and valid loan scenarios, making it critical to fix.

### PoC

In `TwoLendersERC20Loan.t.sol`: 

Set initial borrower duration to : `5184000` in `setUp()`
```solidity
address borrowOrderAddress = DBOFactoryContract.createBorrowOrder(
            oraclesActivated,
            ltvs,
            1400,
            5184000, //864000,
            acceptedPrinciples,
            USDC,
            false,
            0,
            oraclesPrinciples,
            ratio,
            address(0x0),
            10e18
        );
```
and Add the following test function 

```solidity 
function testExtendLoan_underflow() public {
    
    // initialDuration = 60days= 5184000;  // 10 days
        matchOffers();

    // first lender:  maxDeadline1 = 8640000;   // 100 days
    // second lender: maxDeadline2 = 9640000;   // ~111 days
    
    // Warp to day 55
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 55 days); 
    
    // Try to extend loan

    vm.startPrank(borrower);
    AEROContract.approve(address(DebitaV3LoanContract), type(uint256).max);    
    // This call will revert with arithmetic overflow- underflow error. 
    vm.expectRevert();  
    DebitaV3LoanContract.extendLoan();
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```
`run :  forge test --mt testExtendLoan_underflow`
