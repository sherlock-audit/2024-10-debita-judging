# Missing check for stale data might result in inaccurate oracle responses

### Summary

The Chainlink oracle implementation does not verify the staleness of the price feed responses. Consequently, if a feed for an asset becomes inactive or outdated, the system may rely on incorrect price data for calculations.

### Root Cause

The `DebitaChainlink::getThePrice` function fetches asset prices by calling the `latestRoundData` function on the price feed contract. However, this implementation only retrieves the price data without verifying the `updatedAt` timestamp to ensure it is recent. As a result, stale data could inadvertently be used.

```javascript
function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
    // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
    address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
    require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
    require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
    AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

    // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
    // if it's down, revert
    if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
        checkSequencer();
    }
    (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData(); //@audit missing check for stale data

    require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
    require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
    return price;
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

The oracle used to retrive the asset price in the lend/borrow offer is the Chainlink oracle.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The use of outdated price data will lead to incorrect LTV calculations, which could undermine the integrity of the lending and borrowing process.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To ensure data accuracy, retrieve the `updatedAt` timestamp from the `latestRoundData` response. Validate that the elapsed time since `updatedAt` does not exceed the expected heartbeat or a predefined acceptable interval.
