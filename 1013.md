# DebitaPyth.sol: uses 600s instead of 90s in getThePrice()

### Summary

The DebitaPyth contract's `getThePrice()` function allows for price data that could be up to 10 minutes old (600 seconds).

This exposes the protocol to price manipulation risks and outdated price data in volatile market conditions.

### Root Cause

10 mins is a long time window, and token prices can change drastically during this period. This would result in inaccurate/stale price being returned from the oracle. 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- Token price changes drastically within those 10 mins
- High float low FDV tokens are an example

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Outdated price feeds could lead to inaccurate asset valuations
- Potential for price manipulation through strategic timing of transactions
- Higher risk during periods of high market volatility
- Could affect liquidations, collateral calculations, and other price-dependent

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use 90 instead of 600 in `getPriceNoOlderThan()`
