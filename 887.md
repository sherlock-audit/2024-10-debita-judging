# changeOwner() functions are implemented incorrectly

### Summary

AuctionFactory.sol, buyOrderFactory.sol, DebitaV3Aggregator.sol incorrectly implement changeOwner() function which makes it useless.

### Root Cause

Current function implementation is wrong and will not change the state variable it's supposed to change.
```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```

Change the function so it works correctly
```solidity
    function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == _owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = _owner;
    }
```
