# Validation for Chainlink's min and max price is missing

### Summary

Chainlink `min/max` price is not validated, even thought it's required.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L30

Chainlink aggregators have minAnswer and maxAnswer functions to validate prices from latestRoundData and revert transactions if prices fall outside this range. However, these safeguards are currently not used, risking the use of inaccurate prices during sudden market crashes.

To see if feeds are configured, check if they have min/max values. Since the system works with any ERC20 token, you can use many tokens with min/max enabled in pools. Here are a example of aggregator feeds with min/max values set up and ready for use in the system:

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Pool shares can be mispriced due to missing min/max check.

### PoC

```solidity
 function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        
        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```

### Mitigation

Check for min/max price before returning the value.
