# An aggregator can match offers where the borrower will not be able to extend the loan time.

### Summary

The borrow offer having same `duration` and the lend offer having same `maxDuration` can be matched by the aggregator via calling `matchOffers` function.

```solidity
require( borrowInfo.duration >= lendInfo.minDuration && borrowInfo.duration <= lendInfo.maxDuration,"Invalid duration");
```
If the borrower's `duration`  is same as lender's `maxDuration` , then the loan `initialDuration` and the lender's `maxDeadline` will be same.


### Root Cause

The borrower can extend loan duration via calling `extendLoan` function, However the loan can be extended till the `maxDeadline` of an lend offer.
```solidity
uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - alreadyUsedTime - block.timestamp; 
```

But since the `maxDeadline` is set as `maxDuration` of lend offer during `matchOffersV3` function call.
```solidity
maxDeadline: lendInfo.maxDuration + block.timestamp,
```

which means that loan `initialDuration` and the `maxDeadline` will be same in this case, thus no change in extend loan duration.
 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The borrow offer duration and lend offer max duration should not be same.

### Attack Path

The aggregator can match offer like mentioned above, which will not allow any borrower to extend the loan time.

### Impact

The borrower will not able to extend the loan time, thus breaking the core invariant for the borrower.
The borrower will not able to leverage the extend time functionality to repay the loan.

### PoC

Let's consider scenario:

- The borrow offer having `duration` = 50 days, and lend offer having `maxDuration` = 50 days are matched by aggregator.
- Now the loan's `initialDuration` = 50 days and the lender's `maxDeadline` = 50 days.
- The borrower wants to extend the loan duration , since the both are same, thus no change in extended time.

### Mitigation

The `maxDeadline` should always be greater than `initialDuration`.
