# stale prices are not checked for chainlink oracle.

### Summary

In `DebitaChainlink:getThePrice` function, it is possible that chainlink oracle may return a outdated price, The contract should make sure to revert  or use fallback oracle if that is the case. 

### Root Cause

In `DebitaChainlink:getThePrice` when fetchhing the prices using `latestRoundData`, it is not checked if prices it is not stale.

```js
 function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```
### Internal pre-conditions

Borrower/Lender need to set the oracle as chainlink when they create a order. 

### External pre-conditions

Chainlink oracle need to return the outdated prices

### Attack Path

The chainlink oracle may return a stale prices which will effect how the tvl calculation takes place in `DebitaV3Aggregator:matchOffersV3`. 

### Impact

The tvl calculation when matching the loan will be incorrect with the actual market prices.
