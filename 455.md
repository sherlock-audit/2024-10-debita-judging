# `BuyOrder::sellNFT` does not send NFT to buyer

### Summary

Consider the function of [`BuyOrder::sellNFT'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92). It is intended for the seller to react to buyOrder and sell their NFT for the desired amount.
However, as we see - NFT is not sent to the buyerâ€™s wallet,  only to the contract address. 
```solidity
function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
        require(buyInformation.isActive, "Buy order is not active");
        require(
            buyInformation.availableAmount > 0,
            "Buy order is not available"
        );

        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            receiptID
        );
        veNFR receipt = veNFR(buyInformation.wantedToken);
        veNFR.receiptInstance memory receiptData = receipt.getDataByReceipt(
            receiptID
        );
        uint collateralAmount = receiptData.lockedAmount;
        uint collateralDecimals = receiptData.decimals;

        uint amount = (buyInformation.buyRatio * collateralAmount) /
            (10 ** collateralDecimals);
        require(
            amount <= buyInformation.availableAmount,
            "Amount exceeds available amount"
        );

        buyInformation.availableAmount -= amount;
        buyInformation.capturedAmount += collateralAmount;
        uint feeAmount = (amount *
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).sellFee()) / 10000;
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(buyInformation.buyToken),
            msg.sender,
            amount - feeAmount
        );

        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(buyInformation.buyToken),
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).feeAddress(),
            feeAmount
        );

        if (buyInformation.availableAmount == 0) {
            buyInformation.isActive = false;
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).emitDelete(address(this));
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory)._deleteBuyOrder(address(this));
        } else {
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).emitUpdate(address(this));
        }
    }
```
There is no other way to get it out.

### Root Cause

The protocol does not transfer NFT to BuyOrder creator when selling NFT. Also, the contract has no other way of transferring NFT.

NFT is stuck on the contract when selling.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Any user sell his NFT to this BuyOrder

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Broken functionality. Sold nft stuck at the contract. Buyer lost his funds and NFT. High severity issue.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Transfer NFT to buyOrder creator
