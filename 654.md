# Permanently stuck NFT's in Auction contracts

### Summary

In case the borrower fails to repay his loan on time, the lender is allowed to keep his collateral. More specifically if the collateral provided by the borrower is NFT token, the lender or even the borrower can create an auction to sell it. However if there are no buyers or the user just decides to cancel the auction the NFT can't be recovered and will permanently remain stuck in the auction contract.

### Root Cause

The problem is that the auction contract uses `safeTransferFrom()` function for transfers, which requires `onERC721Received` callback implementation from the receiver's side.

Auction::cancelAuction(): https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/ce50bab1067574ae493f4062665b8e28611f2346/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L171-L175

```javascript

function cancelAuction() public onlyActiveAuction onlyOwner {
        s_CurrentAuction.isActive = false;
        // Send NFT back to owner
        IERC721 Token = IERC721(s_CurrentAuction.nftAddress);
        Token.safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            s_ownerOfAuction,
            s_CurrentAuction.nftCollateralID
        );
        ...
```
In this case the `DebitaV3Loan` contract imports the `ERC721Holder`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/ce50bab1067574ae493f4062665b8e28611f2346/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L8

However it misses to inherit it, which results in inretrievable collateral, hence the lender incurs loses

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Few impacts:

1. The lender incurs loses, if no one buys the NFT (collateral) at the specified floor price, he can't recover it
2. If the auction is created by an EOA by directly interacting with the auction factory, the owner also will not be able to withdraw his NFT since it's a non-contract address


### PoC

Here is a simple coded PoC demonstrating the DoS scenario, where the loan contract can't receive NFT tokens when `safeTransferFrom()` is used:

1. Paste the following code in a file and run `forge test --mt testDoS`

```javascript
import {Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {DebitaV3Loan} from "@contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol";
import {ERC721} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract NFT is ERC721 {
    uint256 idCounter;

    constructor() ERC721("NFT", "N") {}

    function mint(address to) public {
        ++idCounter;
        _mint(to, idCounter);
    }
}

contract Tests is Test {
    NFT nft;
    DebitaV3Loan loan;

    address user = makeAddr("user");

    function setUp() external {
        nft = new NFT();
        loan = new DebitaV3Loan();

        nft.mint(user);
    }

    function testDoS() public {
        vm.startPrank(user);
        vm.expectRevert();
        nft.safeTransferFrom(user, address(loan), 1, "");
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

The best fix that nullifies all the risks is to use `transferFrom()`, instead of `safeTransferFrom`. However if the dev team decides to stay with this design, the `DebitaV3Loan` should inherit the `ERC721Holder`, but this way the auctions created due to non-liquidation will force it's users to be only smart contract + having implemented the `onERC721Received` callback function, which is not ideal.
