# multiple get orders/offers method implements incorrect iterative limit

### Summary

The get method used for get orders such as in buyOrderFactory::getActiveBuyOrders assigns wrong iterative limits.
Same issues can be found in multiple code files.


### Root Cause

buyOrderFactory::getActiveBuyOrders is used to get the active buy orders with parameters passed as offset and limit. The limit could be longer than the active orders count, therefor the code make a comparing of the "activeOrderCount"  and "limit" variables before "for" iterative. And variable "length" is reassigned as "activeOrderCount" if "limit" is larger the "activeOrdersCount". However in the "for" loop,  "limit"  parameter is still used as the upbound of the iterative. Variable "length" is never used.

This same issue can be found in multiple places in  protocol's codebase. Such as :
buyOrderFactory::getHistoricalBuyOrders ,

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Query of active orders from users could be reverted if the passed limit larger than allActivateBuyOrders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

consider change the "limit" to "length" in "for" loop:
```diff
function getActiveBuyOrders(uint offset, uint limit){
...
-     for (uint i = offset; i < offset + limit; i++){
+    for (uint i = offset; i < offset + length; i++){
...
}
}
```
