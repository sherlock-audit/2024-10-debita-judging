# Overflow while calculating fee in `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan`.

### Summary

In `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan` function there is an edge case where the execution will get halted and user will not be able to extend there loan.

### Root Cause

The root cause is due to this else statement , which compares the `feeOfMaxDeadline` with `feePerDay` and if it is true then it assigns the value of `feePerDay` to `feeOfMaxDeadline`.

### Internal pre-conditions

NA

### External pre-conditions

`offer.maxDeadline < 1 days`
As there is no minimum value for the offer's `maxDeadline` hence protocol  is giving  the flexibility to the users , for setting the maxDeadline according to there choice. So it is a edge case where the `extendLoan` functionality will be blocked and will not work.

### Attack Path

1. There is a loan with `offer.maxDeadline  =  86300 secs`,  `feePerDay = 4` , `initialDuration= 18 Hours(64,800 secs)
2. In the function `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan()` the feel will be calculated as following.
```solidity
PorcentageOfFeePaid = (m_loan.initialDuration * feePerDay) / 86400 = (64800* 4 ) / 86400 = 3
else if(PorcentageOfFeePaid(3) < minFEE(20) )--> True => PorcentageOfFeePaid  = minFEE(20)
```
3. As `PorcentageOfFeePaid= 20`, Now the execution will go inside the for loop, and inside the for loop if condition will be true `PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee`, Then there will be again some calculations
```solidity
feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) / 86400)  = (86350 * 4) / 86400 = 3
else if(feeOfMaxDeadline(3) < feePerDay(4)) => True => feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay = 4
misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid = 4 - 20 //@audit Overflow
```
4. Hence in this case user will not be able to extend there loan which is directly impacting the core functionality of the protocol.

### Impact

* User will not be able access the `extendLoan` functionality leading the blockage for the core functionality of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

* Add some other checks
