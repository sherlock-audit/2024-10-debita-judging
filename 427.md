# No price feed update functional may result in a broken chainlinkOracle for the given token.

### Summary

Let's take a look at the [setPriceFeed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L71) function in `ChainlinkOracle`.
```solidity
    function setPriceFeeds(address _token, address _priceFeed) public {
        require(msg.sender == multiSig, "Only manager can set price feeds");
        // only declare it once
        require(priceFeeds[_token] == address(0), "Price feed already set");
        priceFeeds[_token] = _priceFeed;
        isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed] = true;
    }
```

We can see that the function only allows the priceFeed to be set once. So there is no way to update it. So there is no way to update it. It is not very clear why these restrictions are necessary for the protocol, if the update is performed by a trusted party - multisig.

### Root Cause

A trusted multisig entity cannot change a price feed that has already been assigned.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The previous price feed failed, but the protocol cannot migrate to the new implementation because the constraints are too strict.

### Attack Path

Chainlink changes the priceFeed for some pair and our contract fails to update, thus always getting outdated data.

### Impact

Impact High
Likelohood: Low
Severity: Medium

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove this check. Allow trusted entity to set price feeds more than once
