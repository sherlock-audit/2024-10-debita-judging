# Potential Exploit in `calculateInterestToPay()` Malicious Borrowers Can Minimize Interest Payments by Delaying Repayment of debt

### Summary

The `calculateInterestToPay` function in `DebitaV3Loan.sol` allows malicious borrowers to delay repayment until the `close deadline (offer.maxDeadline) to minimize interest payments`. The interest calculation is based on the loan's active time (block.timestamp - loanData.startedAt) and does not impose penalties or higher rates for late repayments. This enables borrowers to exploit the system by repaying at the last moment, effectively reducing their borrowing costs while maximizing the use of loaned funds.

### Impact

Reduced Lender Returns:
Lenders lose potential interest earnings as borrowers strategically delay repayments without penalties.

### PoC

1. Lets see this example 
 - A borrower accepts a loan with:
principleAmount = 10,000 DAI
apr = 5%
loanData.startedAt = block.timestamp
offer.maxDeadline = loanData.startedAt + 90 days.

2. Exploit Steps:
- The borrower uses the loaned amount for 89 days without making any payments.
On the 90th day, the borrower repays the loan.
The function calculates interest for the exact active time (90 days) without any high interest for delayed repayment.
3. Result:
- The borrower avoids higher interest costs or penalties for using the funds close to the deadline, paying only the prorated interest for 90 days:
