# Anyone can delete Borrow Order before index was created will delete other user orders

### Summary

`DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol` have reentrancy right after active order and before setup index.
Attacker can exploit this to delete other user order and mess up active orders list.
Breaking core function and unrecoverable.

### Root Cause


Standard reentrancy attack pattern. Change after unsafe external call.

- In `DBOFactory.createBorrowOrder()`, unsafe external call before include new order to active order list. [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L125-L138)
- There is no token whitelist. Token can be custom attack contract.
- Attacker can call delete order using reentrancy. [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L188-L218)
- `DBOFactory.sol` accept delete order with address alone and no safety check. [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L162-L177)


### Internal pre-conditions


- `DBOFactory` have several active orders.
- `activeOrdersCount > 1`

### External pre-conditions


Attacker prepare custom ERC20/ERC721 contract for reentrancy attack.

### Attack Path


- Attacker create a borrow order. A borrow offer contract is created
- The borrow contract is activated immediately. [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L124) `isBorrowOrderLegit[address(borrowOffer)] = true;`
- The modifier `DBOFactory.onlyBorrowOrder` will pass as order was created.
- During token transfer. use reentrancy contract. [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L125-L138)
- Use reentrancy to call delete order on Borrow Order contract. [Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L188)

During delete phase:
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L159-L177>

- Factory will try to delete latest order, but it still have zero address.
- Factory delete order at index 0, which is other user order. Then swap latest index to 0 index.
- Then Factory create new index and add attacker order to active list.
- Attacker order is no longer activated, but still in active list.


### Impact

Breaking Core Function.

The active order list is required to allow web user found/access their active order.
Without this list, user will have to manually find their order contract address through events.

While no funds is lost but it will require serious effort from both developer help and users to manually cancel all ongoing loan. Which is lots of work for a long time so this issue is High.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Move external calls (Token transfer) to the end of function.
