# The owner of `DebitaV3Aggregator` cannot be updated

### Summary

The function [changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682-L686) would not allow the `owner` to transfer their ownership, due to the passed in parameter having the exact same name as the state variable, and the first check being executed against that same parameter. 

### Root Cause

- In [function changeOwner:682](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682) the parameter is with the exact same name as the state variable [owner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L198)
- The first [require](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L683) statement in `changeOwner` will get executed against the passed owner as an argument, instead of the state variable.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The owner of [DebitaV3Aggregator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol) has to call [changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682)

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. The `owner` of `DebitaV3Aggregator` calls changeOwner with the address of the new owner.
2. The call reverts due to `msg.sender` not being equal to `owner` the parameter.
3. The `owner` calls the function again, with their address passed as an argument and the call is successful, however, the `owner` state variable wasn't updated at all, due to the new address being their own address once again. 

### Impact

- The `owner` of [DebitaV3Aggregator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol) cannot be changed at all, which might lead to unintended consequences, such as - the owner's wallet getting compromised and them being unable to set a new owner (to a different address of their own), or simply the owner losing their private key. If access to the owner address is lost, all of the following functions cannot be called: `statusCreateNewOffers, setValidNFTCollateral, setNewFee, setNewMaxFee, setNewMinFee, setNewFeeConnector, setOracleEnabled` 

### PoC

In `BasicDebtaAggregator.t.sol` add the following:

Firstly, import the console with:
`import "forge-std/console2.sol";`

Then, add the following test:
```solidity
    function testChangeOwner() public {
        address newOwner = makeAddr("newOwner");

        // assert that this contract is the owner of the contract `DebitaV3Aggregator`
        assertEq(address(this), DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner());
        console2.log("attempt to change owner, but call reverts");
        vm.expectRevert();
        DebitaV3AggregatorContract.changeOwner(newOwner);
        console2.log("call is successful, but owner is not updated");
        DebitaV3AggregatorContract.changeOwner(address(this));

        // the newOwner was never set and the original owner remains the owner
        assertNotEq(newOwner, DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner());
        assertEq(address(this), DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner());
    }
```
You can execute the test with: `forge test --fork-url https://mainnet.base.org --fork-block-number 21151256 --no-match-path '**Fantom** --mt testChangeOwner -vv`

Console:
```bash
Logs:
  attempt to change owner, but call reverts
  call is successful, but owner is not updated
```
