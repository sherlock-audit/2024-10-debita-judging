# `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan` will revert due to underlow in most cases

### Summary

Consider this particular [point](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L590) in the execution of extendLoan

```solidity
uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;

uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - alreadyUsedTime - block.timestamp;
```
Let's decompose this formula to prove that it can underflow in most cases.

`extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - alreadyUsedTime - block.timestamp` = ` maxDeadline - block.timestamp + startedAt - block.timestamp` = `(startedAt + maxDuration) + startedAt - 2 * block.timestamp`.

It is important to add that `block.timestamp <= startedAt + duration <= startedAt + maxDuration <= maxDeadline`.

Here is a specific example where this will crash due to underflow.

Let's assume that startedAt is 0 for simplicity (counting from the zero point).

duration = 90, maxDuration = 100 => maxDeadline = 0 + 100 = 100.

Let's assume that we call the function in block.timestamp = 60.  Then extendedTime = 100 - 2 * 60 = -20 => underflow.


### Root Cause

Incorrect calculation formula, it gives underflow in any case when alreadyUsedTime > 1/2 maxDuration. 

### Internal pre-conditions

A loan has been created, the user wants to extend the loan.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The key function of the contract will in most cases be unavailable to borrowers due to incorrect formula. High.

### PoC

### Mitigation
