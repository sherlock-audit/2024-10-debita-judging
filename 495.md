# `isBuyOrderLegit` Not Updated on Deletion

### Summary

The missing update to the `isBuyOrderLegit` mapping will cause logical inconsistencies and potential misuse for buy orders as deleted orders remain marked as legitimate, bypassing checks in functions like `onlyBuyOrder`.

### Root Cause

In `buyOrderFactory.sol`, the `_deleteBuyOrder` function does not include a line to set the `isBuyOrderLegit` mapping to `false` when a buy order is deleted.

Examples:
- In `buyOrderFactory.sol:75`, the `_deleteBuyOrder` function fails to update `isBuyOrderLegit[_buyOrder]` to `false`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A buy order must have been created using `createBuyOrder()`, setting its legitimacy flag (`isBuyOrderLegit`) to `true`.
2. The `_deleteBuyOrder()` function is called on the buy order without updating the legitimacy flag.

### External pre-conditions

1. No external checks are required for this issue to manifest.

### Impact

The protocol may allow unintended interactions with deleted buy orders. This could lead to logical inconsistencies, unauthorized access, or even potential exploits if other mechanisms rely on `isBuyOrderLegit` for validation.

### Mitigation

Update the `_deleteBuyOrder` function to set the `isBuyOrderLegit` mapping to `false`:
```solidity
function _deleteBuyOrder(address _buyOrder) public onlyBuyOrder {
    uint index = BuyOrderIndex[_buyOrder];
    BuyOrderIndex[_buyOrder] = 0;

    allActiveBuyOrders[index] = allActiveBuyOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1];
    allActiveBuyOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

    BuyOrderIndex[allActiveBuyOrders[index]] = index;

    activeOrdersCount--;

    // Mark the order as no longer legitimate
    isBuyOrderLegit[_buyOrder] = false;
}
```
