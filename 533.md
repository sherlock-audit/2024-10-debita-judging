### Attack Path

**Instance 1 - veAERO NFT receipt**

Bob owns a veAERO NFT that has a locked amount of 1000 AERO. He deposited it into the `veNFTAerodrome` contract via the [`veNFTAerodrome.deposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/Receipt-veNFT.sol#L63) function and minted with Debita's veAERO NFT receipt.

Bob negotiated with Alice and sold the veAERO NFT receipt to her. Alice made the payment and Bob transferred the veAERO NFT receipt to her.

However, right before the transfer transaction, Bob front-run the transfer transaction and executed [`veNFTVault.withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/veNFTAerodrome.sol#L86) function to withdraw his veAERO NFT from the veAERO NFT receipt. When the transfer transaction is executed, an empty veAERO NFT receipt will be transferred to Alice, and she end up holding a worthless veAERO NFT receipt.

**Instance 2 - TaxTokensReceipt**

The TaxTokensReceipt receipt NFT is subjected to the same issue as it also allows the owner to withdraw the assets within the receipt via the [`TaxTokensReceipt.withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L78) function to carry out an attack similar to the one described in Instance 1.
