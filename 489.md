# Ownerships' tokenURI fail to determine borrower vs lender

### Summary

The Ownerships' tokenURI function in DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol incorrectly assign Borrower / Lender loan ownership type when minting to lenders and borrowers.

### Root Cause

In the `tokenUri` function in [DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol:L84](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol#L84), the Ownership NFT type is determined by
```solidity
string memory _type = tokenId % 2 == 0 ? "Borrower" : "Lender"; 
```
which does not apply in Debita V3 where lenders loan ownership are minted first (one or many), and borrower loan ownership last, as seen in matchOffersV3:
```solidity
// Mint ownership for each lender first
for (uint i = 0; i < lendOrders.length; i++) {
    uint lendID = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract).mint(lendInfo.owner);
}
// Later... mint borrower ownership last
uint borrowID = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract).mint(borrowInfo.owner);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

The Ownerships contract must be initialized and properly linked to DebitaV3Aggregator.

### External pre-conditions

A lending/borrowing match must occur, triggering the minting of ownership NFTs.

### Attack Path

Evil user may be able to convince the victim to buy a Lender NFT for a profit  and receive a Borrower NFT instead.

### Impact

1. Loan ownership NFT badges/images will incorrectly identify if the holder is a lender or borrower
2. Position type misrepresentation: NFTs minted to lenders will show as "Borrower" positions, and NFTs minted to borrowers will show as "Lender" positions
3. Potential for misleading trades based on NFT metadata where users might buy/sell positions believing they represent the opposite role
4. Compromised historical record accuracy of who was lender vs borrower in past loans

For the sake of reference, below are two Debita v2 ownership NFT badges correcty dispaying lender vs borrower:

### PoC

### Mitigation

Either parametrize the Ownerships' mint function for discriminating borrower vs lender, or add function for selecting Borrower vs Lender by tokenId.

Example implementation:

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => bool) public isBorrower;

function mint(address to, bool _isBorrower) public onlyContract returns (uint256) {
    id++;
    _mint(to, id);
    isBorrower[id] = _isBorrower;
    return id;
}

function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view override returns (string memory) {
    require(tokenId <= id, "Token Id does not exist");
    string memory _type = isBorrower[tokenId] ? "Borrower" : "Lender";
    // ... rest of tokenURI logic ...
}
```
