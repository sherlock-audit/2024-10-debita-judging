# Function changeOwner() does not work

### Summary

The input parameter `owner` is exactly the same as variable `owner`. This will cause the changeOwner() does not work.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Aggregator:682](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682), the owner can transfer the ownership to another people.
The problem is that input parameter `owner` is exactly the same with the storage variable `owner`. This will cause that only the input parameter `owner` takes effect in this function's scope. We cannot change owner.
```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```

And changeOwner() in auctionFactoryDebita contract has the same issue.
