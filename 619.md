# [M-4]: The `manager` variable in the `getDataFromUser` function is shadowed potentially changing the function intended functionality

### Summary

In two contracts:

- [Aerodrome/Receipt-veNFT.sol:204](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/Receipt-veNFT.sol?plain=1#L204)
- [Equalizer/Receipt-veNFT.sol:201](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Equalizer/Receipt-veNFT.sol?plain=1#L201) *not in audit scope

the function `getDataFromUser` uses a function parameter `address manager` and a local variable `address manager = _vaultContract.managerAddress();` leading to the local variable shadowing the function parameter.

### Root Cause

In [Aerodrome/Receipt-veNFT.sol:204](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/Receipt-veNFT.sol?plain=1#L204)

uses the same names for both the parameter and a variable in `getDataFromUser` function thus potentially changing the behavior since in the first part of the function the parameter is being used for calculations and after the shadowing occurs the local parameter is used for further calculations.

```solidity
   function getDataFromUser(
@>      address manager,
        uint fromIndex,
        uint stopIndex
    ) external view returns (receiptInstance[] memory) {
        uint amount = balanceOfManagement[manager] > stopIndex
            ? stopIndex
            : balanceOfManagement[manager];

        veNFT veContract = veNFT(nftAddress);
        receiptInstance[] memory nftsDATA = new receiptInstance[](
            amount - fromIndex
        );

        for (uint i; i + fromIndex < amount; i++) {
            uint nftID = ownedTokens[manager][i + fromIndex];
            IVotingEscrow.LockedBalance memory _locked = veContract.locked(
                nftID
            );
          address vault = veContract.ownerOf(nftID);
            veNFTVault _vaultContract = veNFTVault(vault);
            uint receipt = _vaultContract.receiptID();
            uint _decimals = ERC20(_underlying).decimals();

@>          address manager = _vaultContract.managerAddress();
            address currentOwnerOfReceipt = ownerOf(receipt);
            nftsDATA[i] = receiptInstance({
                receiptID: receipt,
                attachedNFT: nftID,
                lockedAmount: uint(int(_locked.amount)),
                lockedDate: _locked.end,
                decimals: _decimals,
                vault: vault,
                underlying: _underlying,
                OwnerIsManager: currentOwnerOfReceipt == manager
            });
        }
        return nftsDATA;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `getDataFromUser` function should be called.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Potentially this could change some of the protocol behavior and receipt data setup for the user when calculations are made with the `manager` parameter in the beginning of the function and afterwards the calculations are made with the `manager` variable retrieved from:

```solidity
address manager = _vaultContract.managerAddress();
```

Shadowing the variable could lead to incorrect comparisons. This issue could also introduce subtle bugs, especially if any changes are made to how `manager` is used in the future.

If manager inside the loop refers to the vault manager (managerAddress), and it's shadowed, the code might mistakenly compare `currentOwnerOfReceipt` to the wrong address.

If the wrong comparison is made, it could either:
**Allow unauthorized withdrawals**: Another user could use the asset (receipt), even if they are not the legitimate manager.
**Prevent valid withdrawals**: The correct manager could be blocked from performing operations because the comparison logic is flawed.

```solidity
nftsDATA[i] = receiptInstance({
                receiptID: receipt,
                attachedNFT: nftID,
                lockedAmount: uint(int(_locked.amount)),
                lockedDate: _locked.end,
                decimals: _decimals,
                vault: vault,
                underlying: _underlying,
@>              OwnerIsManager: currentOwnerOfReceipt == manager
            });
```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. If the intended behavior is to use two different `manager` variables (parameter and a local variable), then renaming the second one will avoid confusion.
2. If this is not the intended behavior, then the logic of the two `manager`s should be revisited.
