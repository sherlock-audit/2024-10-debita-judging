### Attack Path

For context, it is the manager of the veNFT receipt who has the ability to vote on Aerodrome's gauges, not the owner of the veNFT receipt, as shown below.

```solidity
File: Receipt-veNFT.sol
113:     function voteMultiple(
114:         address[] calldata vaults,
115:         address[] calldata _poolVote,
116:         uint256[] calldata _weights
117:     ) external {
118:         for (uint i; i < vaults.length; i++) {
119:             require(
120:                 msg.sender == veNFTVault(vaults[i]).managerAddress(),
121:                 "not manager"
122:             );
123:             require(isVaultValid[vaults[i]], "not vault");
124:             veNFTVault(vaults[i]).vote(_poolVote, _weights);
125:         }
126:     }
```

When the collateral is the veNFT, if the borrower defaults, the veNFT receipt will either be sent directly to the lender or to the buyer from the auction. Either way, the consequences are the same.

A malicious borrower, who is the existing manager of the veNFT receipt, can back-run the veNFT transfer transaction and vote in the gauges on Velo/Aerodrome to their advantage. For example, if the borrower is a liquidity provider (LP) for certain gauges, they can direct votes to those gauges, increasing the incentives they receive.

Alternatively, the malicious manager may choose to grief the new owner of the veNFT receipt by voting for highly unprofitable gauges with minimal incentive rewards. This action would ensure the new owner receives little to no rewards in the next epoch, leading to a loss of funds.

In either scenario, once the malicious manager votes in the current epoch, the new owner is unable to cast votes until the next epoch.

### Impact

High. Loss of funds due to a griefing attack.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Overwrite the internal `_transfer` hook of the veNFT receipt to update the current manager to the new owner when it is being transferred to a new owner during claiming collateral OR during an auction.
