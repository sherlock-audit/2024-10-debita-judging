# An attacker could block the full utilization of a user's lending offer, leading to funds being permanently locked in the contract.

### Summary

There is a critical vulnerability in the ``deleteOrder`` function, exacerbated by its integration with the ``changePerp`` function. This flaw allows a malicious user to manipulate the lifecycle of lending offers, rendering the protocol unreliable and potentially disrupting the functionality of legitimate users.

The root cause of the issue lies in the improper state management of lending offers, where an active lending offer can be repeatedly deleted through the misuse of the ``changePerp`` function. This exploit not only causes underflows in the ``activeOrdersCount`` variable but also compromises the integrity of the protocol's data structures.

### Root Cause

The core vulnerability lies in the absence of validation within the ``deleteOrder`` function to ensure that the target order is still active. This flaw allows the same order to be deleted multiple times, leading to the following consequences:

1. **Repeated Deletion Corrupts Data Structures**: Each deletion operation replaces the order at the given index with the last active order and decrements the ``activeOrdersCount``. Repeated deletions, however, reduce ``activeOrdersCount`` below its intended value, resulting in corrupted ``allActiveLendOrders`` and ``LendOrderIndex`` mappings.

2. **Underflow in activeOrdersCount**: When legitimate users or automated processes attempt to delete or cancel offers after the malicious reduction of ``activeOrdersCount`` to 0, the line:

``allActiveLendOrders[index] = allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]``;
triggers an underflow, as subtracting 1 from 0 results in an invalid array index.

3. **Reversion of Contract Functions**: Both the cancel offer and accept offer processes depend on the integrity of ``activeOrdersCount``. When this value becomes inconsistent, these functions revert unexpectedly, disrupting the normal lifecycle of lending offers.

### Attack Path

The exploit hinges on a malicious user creating a lending offer and leveraging the ``changePerp`` function to repeatedly delete active orders. The key steps in the attack are as follows:

1. **Setup the Lending Offer**:

The attacker creates a lending offer and sets ``lendInformation.perpetual`` to ``true``, ensuring the offer remains active indefinitely.
```solidity
function initialize(
        address _aggregatorContract,
        bool _perpetual,
        bool[] memory _oraclesActivated,
        bool _lonelyLender,
        uint[] memory _maxLTVs,
        uint _apr,
        uint _maxDuration,
        uint _minDuration,
        address _owner,
        address _principle,
        address[] memory _acceptedCollaterals,
        address[] memory _oracleIDS_Collateral,
        uint[] memory _ratio,
        address _oracleID_Principle,
        uint _startedLendingAmount
    ) public initializer {
        aggregatorContract = _aggregatorContract;
        isActive = true;
        // update lendInformation
        lendInformation = LendInfo({
            lendOrderAddress: address(this),
            perpetual: _perpetual,  <<@Audit set to true
            oraclesPerPairActivated: _oraclesActivated,
            lonelyLender: _lonelyLender,
            maxLTVs: _maxLTVs,
            apr: _apr,
            maxDuration: _maxDuration,
            minDuration: _minDuration,
            owner: _owner,
            principle: _principle,
            acceptedCollaterals: _acceptedCollaterals,
            oracle_Collaterals: _oracleIDS_Collateral,
            maxRatio: _ratio,
            oracle_Principle: _oracleID_Principle,
            startedLendingAmount: _startedLendingAmount,
            availableAmount: _startedLendingAmount
        });

        factoryContract = msg.sender;
    }
```

2. **Utilize the Lending Offer Fully**:

The attacker ensures the lending offer is fully utilized, such that:
```solidity
lendInformation.availableAmount == 0
```
3. **Invoke the changePerp Function**:

With the lending offer fully utilized, the attacker calls the ``changePerp`` function and sets ``_perpetual`` to ``false``.
The ``changePerp`` function then triggers:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L178
```solidity
function changePerpetual(bool _perpetual) public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        require(isActive, "Offer is not active");

        lendInformation.perpetual = _perpetual;
        if (_perpetual == false && lendInformation.availableAmount == 0) {
      IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
 @> IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
        } else {
            IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
        }
    }
```
This deletes the active lending order and decrements activeOrdersCount.
4. **Repeat the Deletion**:

The attacker can repeatedly toggle ``lendInformation.perpetual`` between ``true`` and ``false``, triggering successive calls to ``deleteOrder`` until ``activeOrdersCount`` is reduced to ``0``.


### Impact

The exploit has far-reaching consequences for the protocol and its users:

1. **Corruption of Active Orders Data**:
Repeated calls to ``deleteOrder`` corrupt the ``allActiveLendOrders``  and the ``LendOrderIndex`` mapping, resulting in inconsistencies.
2. **Underflow in activeOrdersCount**:
The repeated decrements in ``activeOrdersCount`` eventually lead to an underflow. When users or the protocol attempt to access an index using:
``allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]``;
it results in an invalid memory access and a revert.
3. **Legitimate Users Unable to Cancel Offers**:
Legitimate users attempting to cancel their lending offers face reverts due to the corrupted ``activeOrdersCount``.
4. **Disruption of Offer Lifecycle lead to funds been stucked in the Contract**:
When a fully utilized offer is marked for deletion via:
```solidity
if (lendInformation.availableAmount == 0 && !lendInformation.perpetual) {
    IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
}
```
the underflow in activeOrdersCount causes the protocol to revert, preventing the offer from being properly closed.


### PoC

Consider a scenario where there are five active lending offers:
```solidity
allActiveLendOrders = [A, B, C, D, E]
LendOrderIndex = {A: 0, B: 1, C: 2, D: 3, E: 4}
activeOrdersCount = 5
```

1.  **Initial State**:
- A malicious user creates a perpetual lending offer A and fully utilizes it (``lendInformation.availableAmount == 0``).
- The user calls changePerp(false):
``deleteOrder(A)`` is invoked, deleting A from ``allActiveLendOrders``.
The order at index 0 is replaced with the last active order (E), and ``activeOrdersCount`` is decremented to 4.
2. **Repeated Calls**:
- The attacker toggles perpetual back to true and repeats the process:
- **Second Call**: allActiveLendOrders[0] (now E) is replaced with D.
- allActiveLendOrders = [D, B, C, 0, 0]
activeOrdersCount = 3
- **Third Call**: allActiveLendOrders[0] (now D) is replaced with C.
allActiveLendOrders = [C, B, 0, 0, 0]
activeOrdersCount = 2
3. **Final State**:
After successive deletions, ``activeOrdersCount`` is reduced to 0, corrupting the state of the system.

I have also prepared a test suite that can be run on remix IDE to illustrate the issue more carefully
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract LendOrderManager {
    // State variables
    mapping(uint => address) public allActiveLendOrders; // Mapping of order index to address
    mapping(address => uint) public LendOrderIndex; // Mapping of lend order address to index
    uint public activeOrdersCount;

    // Modifier to restrict access (for simplicity, we allow anyone for testing)
    modifier onlyLendOrder() {
        require(msg.sender != address(0), "Caller must be a valid address");
        _;
    }

    // Function to add a new lend order (for testing purposes)
    function addOrder(address _lendOrder) external {
        require(_lendOrder != address(0), "Invalid lend order address");
        allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount] = _lendOrder;
        LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder] = activeOrdersCount;
        activeOrdersCount++;
    }
  
    // The deleteOrder function you want to test
    function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder {
        uint index = LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder];

        // Reset the index of the lend order being deleted
        LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder] = 0;

        // Move the last lend order to the index of the deleted lend order
        allActiveLendOrders[index] = allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1];
        LendOrderIndex[allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]] = index;

        // Remove the last lend order from the list
        allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

        // Decrease the active orders count
        activeOrdersCount--;
    }


    // Helper function to get the active lend order at a specific index (for testing purposes)
    function getLendOrder(uint index) external view returns (address) {
        return allActiveLendOrders[index];
    }

    // Helper function to get the index of a specific lend order (for testing purposes)
    function getLendOrderIndex(address _lendOrder) external view returns (uint) {
        return LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder];
    }
}
```


### Mitigation

Set ``isActive`` to ``false`` After Deletion:

Modify the ``changePerp`` function to deactivate the lending offer after calling ``deleteOrder``:
```solidity
if (_perpetual == false && lendInformation.availableAmount == 0) {
    IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
    IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
    isActive = false; // Deactivate the lending offer
}
```
