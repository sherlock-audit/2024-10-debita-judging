# A malicious user can delete all the lendOrders in factory by repeatedly calling cancelOffer() & addFunds()

### Summary

A malicious user can delete all the lendOrders in the factory by repeatedly calling `cancelOffer()` & `addFunds()`

### Root Cause

In [addFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162)(), owner can add funds even after lendOrder is already cancelled ie it doesn't check if lendOrder is active or not. Also, cancelOffer() can be called again & again as this also doesn't check if lendOrder is active or not.

### Attack Path

To understand this issue, let's go step by step:

1. Suppose there are 10 lendOrders created by factory ie index = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] & 3rd index is owned by user1
2. User1 decided to cancel his lendOrder and called cancelOffer(), this will set the availableAmount = 0 & call deleteOrder() on the factory contract
```solidity
    function cancelOffer() public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        uint availableAmount = lendInformation.availableAmount;
        lendInformation.perpetual = false;
@>      lendInformation.availableAmount = 0;
        require(availableAmount > 0, "No funds to cancel");
        isActive = false;

        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            availableAmount
        );
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
@>      IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
        // emit canceled event on factory
    }
```
3. deleteOrder() will set index to 0 & will replace the last index(9th) with 3rd index & will decrease the activeOrdersCount ie remaining index = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```solidity
    function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder {
        uint index = LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder];
        LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder] = 0;

        // switch index of the last borrow order to the deleted borrow order
        allActiveLendOrders[index] = allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1];
        LendOrderIndex[allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]] = index;

        // take out last borrow order
        allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);
        activeOrdersCount--;
    }
``` 
4. Now, user1 calls addFunds() to add funds, which will increase the lendInformation.availableAmount
```solidity
    function addFunds(uint amount) public nonReentrant {
...
@>      lendInformation.availableAmount += amount;
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
    }
```
5. Again, user1 will call cancelOffer() and require statement will pass because at step-4 we added funds to increase availableAmount. Then again deleteOrder() of factory will be called
6. This time deleteOrder() will replace the 8th(last index) with 0th index and count will decrease. User1 can repeat this process again and again to remove all the lendOrder from the factory

### Impact

A malicious user can delete all the lendOrder from factory contact, which will result in unexpected behavior/result when a original lendOrder is deleted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Don't allow owner to add funds when lendOrder is not active. Also, add this check in cancelOffer()
```diff
    function addFunds(uint amount) public nonReentrant {
+       require(isActive, "Offer is not active");
        require(
            msg.sender == lendInformation.owner ||
                IAggregator(aggregatorContract).isSenderALoan(msg.sender),
            "Only owner or loan"
        );
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        lendInformation.availableAmount += amount;
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
    }
```
