# Lack of Collateral Return in `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory::deleteBorrowOrder` leads to bricked collateral

### Summary

The `deleteBorrowOrder` function lacks proper handling of collateral associated with a borrow order. When the function deletes a borrow order, any collateral held by the borrow order contract is not returned to the rightful owner. This oversight could lead to the permanent locking of ERC20 tokens or ERC721 assets in the borrow order contract, rendering them inaccessible i.e. bricked.

### Root Cause

The `deleteBorrowOrder` function does not include logic to transfer collateral back to the borrower during the deletion process. Without explicit collateral management, the function leaves associated assets stranded in the borrow order contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `deleteBorrowOrder` function is invoked by an authorized caller with an active borrow order address.
2. The collateral assets (ERC20 or ERC721) are held by the borrow order contract.

### External pre-conditions

1. Borrowers have deposited collateral into the borrow order contract during order creation.
2. No external mechanism exists to recover collateral once the borrow order is deleted.

### Attack Path

1. A borrower creates a borrow order and deposits collateral (ERC20 or ERC721) into the borrow order contract.
2. The borrow order is deleted by an authorized party.
3. The function fails to transfer the collateral back to the borrower, bricking the assets in the borrow order contract.

### Impact

Borrowers lose access to their collateralized assets, causing financial harm.

### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

1. Add logic to return collateral to the borrower before removing the borrow order.
2. Ensure collateral has been returned before proceeding with the deletion.
3. Emit events for all collateral transfers to ensure traceability
