# Flawed design leads to a loss of funds for the lender.

### Summary

[**Liquidations of loans are time-based**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L85), meaning a lender can only claim the borrower's collateral when the loan's deadline has passed. However, there could be scenarios where loans need to be liquidated before the deadline. For instance, if the value of the collateral drops during the course of the loan, and it becomes less than the debt owed, the lender should have the option to liquidate the loan early. Waiting until the loan's deadline could result in a loss of funds for the lender.

**NOTE**: This is a design decision by the protocol, but I believe it is flawed, as it may lead to a loss of funds for the lender. The typical scenario where the price changes (as explained in the **attack path** section) is not addressed in the protocol documentation or the README. Therefore, I consider that this issue might be valid. Furthermore, when reviewing [Sherlock's standards](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/guidelines#iii.-sherlocks-standards), we find the last standard rule stating:

>6. Design decisions are not valid issues. Even if the design is suboptimal, **but doesn't imply any loss of funds**, these issues are considered informational.

### Root Cause

The design decision of not allowing the loan to be liquidated until the end of its duration can cause a loss of funds for the lender.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- The collateral token's price decreases.
- The debt token's price increases.

### Attack Path

**Initial balances**
- Lender: 1500 USDC
- Borrower: 1 WETH = 2000 USD

**Initial Loan Status:**
- Collateral amount: 1 WETH
- Principle amount: 1500 USDC
- Duration: 2 months
- WETH price: 2000 USD
- USDC price: 1 USD
- Collateral in USD: 2000 USD
- Principle in USD: 1500 USD

**1 Month Passed, Price Changes:**
- WETH price: 1500 USD
- USDC price: 1 USD
- Collateral in USD: 1500 USD
- Principle in USD: 1500 USD

At this point, it would be ideal for the lender to liquidate the loan, as they are not losing anything. However, the lender knows that if the price continues to drop, they will not only lose the interest but also receive far less than the amount originally lent.

**End of the Loan:**
- WETH price: 1200 USD
- USDC price: 1 USD
- Collateral in USD: 1200 USD
- Principle in USD: 1500 USD

The borrower will likely not repay, as holding the debt allows them to avoid paying interest, and the debt is now more valuable than their collateral. When the lender retrieves the collateral, they will end up with less than the original loan amount.

**Ending balances**
- Lender: 1 WETH = 1200 USD
- Borrower: 1500 USDC

### Impact

The lender can end up with less funds than he initially began.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow liquidations in cases where the prices change significantly.
