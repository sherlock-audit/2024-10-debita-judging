# Lack of Exponent Handling for Fixed-Point Price Representation in Pyth Oracle

## Summary

The `getThePrice()` function does not properly account for the fixed-point exponent used in the price feed data from the Pyth network. As a result, the price retrieved may be incorrectly scaled unless the exponent is handled explicitly.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Pyth network provides price data in a fixed-point format, where the price and its confidence interval are both scaled by an exponent. According to the Pyth documentation, the price is represented as an integer multiplied by 10^exponent. This means that to correctly interpret the price, it must be scaled by 10^-exponent.

 In the `DebitaPyth.sol`, the function [getThePrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaPyth.sol#L25-L41) retrieves the price from the Pyth network through the `pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan()` function. However, the price returned by `getPriceNoOlderThan()` is not adjusted by the `exponent`, which may lead to incorrect price values being returned.
 
 ```js
 function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        bytes32 _priceFeed = priceIdPerToken[tokenAddress];
        require(_priceFeed != bytes32(0), "Price feed not set");
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");

        // Get the price from the pyth contract, no older than 90 seconds
@>      PythStructs.Price memory priceData = pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan(
            _priceFeed,
            600
        );

        // Check if the price feed is available and the price is valid
        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(priceData.price > 0, "Invalid price");
@>      return priceData.price; 
    }
 ```
 The issue arises because `priceData.price` is returned without being adjusted by the `exponent`. According to the [Pyth fixed-point representation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#fixed-point-numeric-representation), if the exponent is negative (e.g., -5), the price value must be divided by 10^5 (or 100,000) to correctly interpret the price.

 For example, if the `priceData.price` is 12276250 and the exponent is -5, the correct price should be 122.7625.

 Without applying this exponent adjustment, the contract would return 12276250, which is an incorrect value in terms of USD.

## Impact

Wrong prices end up getting used from pyth oracle.
 
 ## Recommendation
```js
// ensure exponent is handled correctly
    return priceData.price * (10 ** uint256(-priceData.exponent));
```
