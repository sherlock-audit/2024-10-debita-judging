# addFunds can be added on cancelOffer.

### Summary

as there in cancelOffer we are canceling the offer but we can still call the addFunds to add funds to that offer.

### Root Cause

 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162

function addFunds(uint amount) public nonReentrant {
        require(
            msg.sender == lendInformation.owner ||
                IAggregator(aggregatorContract).isSenderALoan(msg.sender),
            "Only owner or loan"
        );
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        lendInformation.availableAmount += amount;
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
    }

There is no check to see whether the offer has already been cancelled or not.
