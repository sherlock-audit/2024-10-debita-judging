# Incorrect Handling of Oracle Price Feed Decimals

### Summary

In doing calculations, `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3`  assumes a fixed precision of 10 ** 8  for all price feeds, which is incorrect as Chainlink oracles can have varying decimal precisions. This assumption leads to misaligned calculations, especially when price feeds deviate from the expected 8 decimals.

### Root Cause

The protocol hardcodes 8 decimal places for oracle price normalization:

```solidity
  uint256 ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = (priceCollateral_BorrowOrder * 10 ** 8) / pricePrinciple;
```
Later, it attempts to adjust for token decimals:

```solidity
 uint256 ratio = (value * (10 ** principleDecimals)) / (10 ** 8);
```
The fundamental issue is:

1. The initial calculation hardcodes 10**8 multiplication
2. Different Chainlink price feeds return prices with varying decimal precision:
  - ETH/USD: 8 decimals
  - USDC/USD: 6 decimals
  - Some pairs use 18 decimals
3. The final ratio adjustment only accounts for token decimals but not oracle decimals
4. This creates a decimal precision mismatch that compounds through the LTV calculations

### Impact

- Incorrect Collateral Ratios: Calculations involving ratios or weighted averages will be off by orders of magnitude when decimals differ from the assumed precision.
- Skewed APR and Matching: Imbalances in borrower-lender matches due to miscalculated collateral-to-principal ratios.
- Potential Failures: Overflow or zero-value errors for feeds exceeding or deviating from the hardcoded assumptions (e.g., 6 or 18+ decimals).

### PoC

The vulnerability manifests in the lending ratio calculation flow:

1. Get oracle prices (with different decimal precisions)
2. Multiply collateral price by hardcoded 10**8
3. Divide by principle price
4. Apply LTV ratio
5. Attempt decimal correction using only token decimals

The decimal mismatch means the final ratio will be off by a factor corresponding to the difference in decimal precision between the two oracles.

### Mitigation

Use AggregatorV3Interface.decimals() for each price feed
Retrieve the decimal precision dynamically.
Normalize the price feed values to a consistent scale (e.g., 18 decimals).
Replace hardcoded 10**8 with dynamic scaling
