# `changeOwner` function will prevent new owner from modifying critical parameters in `DebitaV3Aggregator`, `auctionFactoryDebita`, `buyOrderFactory`

### Summary

The use of the same parameter name `owner` in the `changeOwner` function as the state variable `owner` will cause a potential **ownership change failure** for the **new owner** as **the current owner** will fail to update the state variable, leaving the old owner with control. This flaw allows the current owner to retain control, preventing the new owner from modifying critical parameters such as fees, loan offers, and collateral settings.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:682`, the choice to use the same parameter name `owner` as the state variable `owner` is a mistake as it causes a conflict in the `changeOwner` function. The state variable is not updated when the function is called, preventing the actual ownership transfer and allowing the original owner to retain control over critical parameters.

### Attack Path

1. The **owner** calls `changeOwner()` function, but it doesn't actually update the `owner` state variable due to a naming conflict with the local `owner` variable.
2. This allows the **incorrect owner**(`Old Owner`) to call functions like `statusCreateNewOffers()`, `setValidNFTCollateral()`, `setNewFee()`, `setNewMaxFee()`, `setNewFeeConnector()`, and `setNewMinFee()`.
3. The **incorrect owner** can alter critical parameters, affecting the contractâ€™s functionality, even though the ownership transfer failed.

### Impact

The failure to properly transfer ownership will allow the **incorrect owner** to modify critical parameters, such as fees and collateral settings, potentially causing financial loss, disruption of contract operations, or unintended behavior. This could undermine trust in the system and compromise the security and integrity of the contract.

### Mitigation

```diff
+    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        // @audit owner is local variable - can't change owner
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
+        owner = newOwner;
    }
```
