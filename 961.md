# DebitaChainlink oracle implementation doesnt sufficiently check the sequencerUptimeFeed

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L30-L47

The `DebitaChainlink` contract has `sequencerUptimeFeed` checks in place to assert if the sequencer on `Arbitrum` is running, but these checks are not implemented correctly. Since the protocol implements some checks for the `sequencerUptimeFeed` status, it should implement all of the checks.

The [[chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds)](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) say that `sequencerUptimeFeed` can return a 0 value for `startedAt` if it is called during an "invalid round"

### Impact

Inadequate checks to confirm the correct status of the `sequencerUptimeFeed` in the `DebitaChainlink::getPrice` contract will cause `getPrice()` to not revert even when the sequencer uptime feed is not updated or is called in an invalid round.
