# underflow leads to be impossible to execute extendLoan function

### Summary

in DebitaV3Loan.sol:extendLoan there is a redundant memory variable extendedTime

which is calculated as extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - alreadyUsedTime -  block.timestamp


where alreadyUsedTime is  alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt

 
  
if borrower decided to extend the loan after most times of it's deadline was gone this calculation will lead to the negative number, which will revert the function
According to the DebitaV3 docs there is no any limitations related to this case
  
  


### Root Cause

DebitaV3Loan.sol:extendLoan variable extendTime

### Internal pre-conditions

there is should be an any active order

### External pre-conditions

Most part of the deadline should gone before this will happens

### Attack Path

Example 
m_loan.startedAt = 900
block.timestamp = 1400
offer.maxDeadline = 1500
=>
alreadyUsedTime = 1400 - 900 //500
extendedTime = 1500- 500 - 1400 = -400

-400 leading to error which breaks function execution 

### Impact

Borrower won't be able to extend a loan as he might be expected
Lender won't receive an additional fee for loan being extended
Protocol won't receive an additional fee

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Delete this variable, it is unusable in this context
