# missing `isActive` check in `updateBorrowOrder` Function and Inconsistent Validation of Input Arrays

### Summary
The updateBorrowOrder function has several issues that may lead to incorrect behavior. These include missing checks for the active status of the borrow order and inconsistencies in validation logic for array lengths during updates compared to the creation process.

### Code Snippet:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L232-L252

### Vulnerability Details
1. Lack of Active Status Check

Description: The function does not verify whether the borrow order is currently active before allowing updates.

Impact: If a borrow order is inactive, updates may be applied to an order that should not be modified. This can lead to inconsistent states and potentially impact user trust or system integrity.

Recommendation: Add a check for the active status of the borrow order before proceeding with updates.
```solidity
require(isActive, "Offer is not active");
```

2. Inconsistent Validation of Input Arrays

Description: During the creation of a borrow order, the lengths of `_LTVs` and `_ratios `are validated against `_acceptedPrinciples.length`. However, in the `updateBorrowOrder` function, `newRatios.length` is  checked against `newLTVs.length`, and not `acceptedPrinciples.length`.

Impact: This inconsistency may allow invalid updates, such as mismatched or incomplete data, leading to runtime errors or unintended behavior during further operations.

Recommendation: Ensure consistency in validation logic by verifying that newLTVs.length and newRatios.length match acceptedPrinciples.length:

```solidity
require(
    newLTVs.length == borrowInformation.acceptedPrinciples.length,
    "Invalid LTVs"
);
require(
    newRatios.length == borrowInformation.acceptedPrinciples.length,
    "Invalid ratios"
);
```
