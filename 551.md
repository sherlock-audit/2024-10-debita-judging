# Delete/cancel buy order function only returns remaining tokens, but forget to return any NFT purchase so far

### Attack Path

Assume that Bob put 1000 USDC as `buyToken` in the buy order to purchase veAERO NFT.

Someone sold his veAERO NFT to Bob's buy order and obtained 500 USDC in exchange. The buy order now has 500 USDC remaining, plus one veAERO NFT.

Bob decided to cancel his buy order. However, the issue is that it will only return the remaining 500 USDC back to Bob, but the veAERO NFT purchased will remain stuck in the buy order.

```solidity
File: buyOrder.sol
75:     function deleteBuyOrder() public onlyOwner {
76:         require(buyInformation.isActive, "Buy order is not active");
77:         // save amount on memory
78:         uint amount = buyInformation.availableAmount;
79:         buyInformation.isActive = false;
80:         buyInformation.availableAmount = 0;
81: 
82:         SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
83:             IERC20(buyInformation.buyToken),
84:             buyInformation.owner,
85:             amount
86:         );
```

### Impact

High. Delete order feature is broken, leading to NFT being stuck in the contract. Loss of assets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When a buy order is canceled, return all remaining buy tokens AND any veAERO NFT already purchased so far.
