# Confidence interval of Pyth Network's price is not validated

### Summary

The Pyth network's price data includes a confidence range that shows how certain they are about each price. When you have a price 'p', the confidence range 'σ' helps show how much that price might vary. Pyth's documentation suggests ways to use this confidence range for better security. One way is to check if 'σ / p' is too high - if it is, you can pause trading to stay safe.

Right now, the protocol isn't using this confidence range at all. It would be safer to start using it as Pyth suggests, which would help prevent users from exploiting incorrect prices.

Check the [Pyth documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals), to see the importance to check the returned value to prevent the contract from accepting untrusted prices.

### Root Cause

No check in the function mentioned below:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaPyth.sol#L25

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user can take advantage of the price differencesof

### Impact

1. The oracle could return untrusted price, which would mess up the whole calculations when using the `MixOracle`

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Add this check to the `DebitaPyth::getThePrice` function

```diff
+       if (priceData.conf > 0 && (priceData.price / int64(priceData.conf) < minConfidenceRatio)) {
+           revert();
+       }
```
