### Attack Path

The protocol has implemented the `veNFTAerodrome` NFT receipt contract to allow users to deposit their veAERO NFT into this contract and a `veNFTAerodrome` NFT receipt will then be minted to the users.

The `veNFTAerodrome` NFT receipt will be used within the protocol during lending and borrowing.

As the users are the managers of the `veNFTAerodrome` NFT receipt, it gives the users the ability to continue performing actions such as voting and claiming rewards via the veAERO NFT that they owned earlier, even though the `veNFTAerodrome` NFT receipt resides within the Loan address and does not reside in their wallet.

From the [Aerodrome docs](https://aerodrome.finance/docs):

> 1. **veAERO Voters** are rewarded (proportionally to locked amounts) for their votes with 100% of the protocol trading fees from the previous epoch and any additional voters incentives from the current epoch.

The veAERO NFT allows users to claim two (2) kinds of rewards:

1. Bribes/incentives
2. Trading fee

The following shows that on-chain [Aerodrome's Voter](https://basescan.org/address/0x16613524e02ad97eDfeF371bC883F2F5d6C480A5#code#L743) contract consists of `claimBribes` and `claimFees` functions, which allow users to claim Bribes/incentives and trading fees, respectively.

```solidity
    /// @notice Claim bribes for a given NFT.
    /// @dev Utility to help batch bribe claims.
    /// @param _bribes  Array of BribeVotingReward contracts to collect from.
    /// @param _tokens  Array of tokens that are used as bribes.
    /// @param _tokenId Id of veNFT that you wish to claim bribes for.
    function claimBribes(address[] memory _bribes, address[][] memory _tokens, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice Claim fees for a given NFT.
    /// @dev Utility to help batch fee claims.
    /// @param _fees    Array of FeesVotingReward contracts to collect from.
    /// @param _tokens  Array of tokens that are used as fees.
    /// @param _tokenId Id of veNFT that you wish to claim fees for.
    function claimFees(address[] memory _fees, address[][] memory _tokens, uint256 _tokenId) external;
```

However, the issue is that the `veNFTAerodrome` contract only implements a feature to claim bribes, but it is missing out on a feature to allow the users to claim the trading fee rewards within their veAERO NFT. Thus, users are unable to claim the trading fee rewards, leading to a loss of assets for the users.

155:     ) external onlyFactory {
156:         voterContract voter = voterContract(getVoterContract_veNFT());
157:         voter.claimBribes(_bribes, _tokens, attached_NFTID);
```

### Impact

High. Users are unable to claim the trading fee rewards earned within their veAERO NFT, leading to a loss of assets for the users.
