# Interest accrued will get stuck inside the DebitaV3Loan contract when the borrower fails to pay the debt before the extended deadline.




### Summary

Interest that has been deducted from the borrower when they extend the loan gets stuck inside the DebitaV3Loan contract if the borrower still fails to pay the debt.


### Root Cause

When a `borrower` extends a loan, the `interest` aggregated till then is calculated for each offer and is transferred from the borrower's address to the `DebitaV3Loan` contract.[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L614-L620)

If the borrower has succefully paid the debt later , then without any issue the interest will be tranferred to the lenders address when they call `claimDebt()`.[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L304-L308) 

But the problem arises when borrowers fail to pay the debt within the extended deadline.

This results in lender calling the `claimCollateralAsLender() `, and the collatteral is transferred to the `lender` who is also the `msg.sender`. 
His `ownrship NFTId` is aso burned in the same process.[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L340-L372)

Now the interest paid by the borrower while extending the deadline is stuck inside the contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

Borrower fails to pay the debt even after extending the loan.

### External pre-conditions

        uint loanBalanceAfterClaimCollateral = IERC20(AERO).balanceOf(loan); //balanceAfterClaimCollateral after is supposed to 0 , since all collatteral is transferred to the lender.
        
        assertEq( intersetToClaimAfterExtendingDeadline , loanBalanceAfterClaimCollateral); 
        /* but as we can see , interest that has been claimed while extending the loan is still present in the loan Contract. And theres no way to retrieve those funds.*/
    }
```
### Mitigation


Add a new function that allows protocol to sweep the remaining Loan balance to the feeContract or let the lender receive those accumulated interest also by adding a call to claimInterest() in the   claimCollateralAsLender().
