# Sales cannot be converted to dutch auctions due to `editFloorPrice()` reverting

### Summary

Whenever a user creates an auction with an initial price equal to the floor price, it is equivalent to a sale in a traditional marketplace. However, the owner of the auction currently cannot change its floor price to convert it into a Dutch auction, as the`editFloorPrice()` function in `Auction.sol` reverts.

### Root Cause

In [Auction.sol:203](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L203-L204), the difference between the initial price and the new floor price is divided by the `tickPerBlock` which is equal to zero for sales.
As a result, it reverts whenever users attempt to change their sales to dutch auctions.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `createAuction()` with `_initAmount == _floorAmount` to create a sale.
2. The user decides to change their auction from a sale to a Dutch auction, either due to a change of mind or because his NFT has not sold at the initial price set. To do so, they call `editFloorPrice()`, but the call reverts.

### Impact

Users will not be able to change the floor price of their sale so that it becomes a dutch auction.

### PoC

The following should be added in `Auction.t.sol`:

```solidity
DutchAuction_veNFT public SecondAuction;
VotingEscrow public SecondABIERC721Contract;
```

Additionally, this should be added to `Auction.t.sol::setUp()`:

```solidity
    deal(AERO, buyer, 1000e18, false);
    SecondABIERC721Contract = VotingEscrow(veAERO);
    vm.startPrank(buyer);

    ERC20Mock(AERO).approve(address(SecondABIERC721Contract), 1000e18);
    uint secondId = SecondABIERC721Contract.createLock(100e18, 365 * 4 * 86400);
        
    SecondABIERC721Contract.approve(address(factory), secondId);
    address _secondAuction = factory.createAuction(
        secondId,
        veAERO,
        AERO,
        100e18,
        100e18,
        86400
    );
    SecondAuction = DutchAuction_veNFT(_secondAuction);
        
    vm.stopPrank();
```

For all old tests to work when the new changes are added, the following changes need to be made to existing tests as they perform checks to the number of auctions:

```diff
function testCancelAuction() public {
    ... ...

-    assertEq(auctionsBefore.length, 1);
+    assertEq(auctionsBefore.length, 2);
    assertEq(auctionsBefore[0].isActive, true);
    assertEq(auctionsBefore[0].initAmount, 100e18);
-    assertEq(auctionsAfter.length, 0);
+    assertEq(auctionsAfter.length, 1);
    ... ...
}
```

```diff
function testReadMultipleAuctions() public {
    ... ...
-    assertEq(auctions.length, 3);
+    assertEq(auctions.length, 4);
    assertEq(auctions[0].initAmount, 100e18);
-    assertEq(auctions[1].initAmount, 300e18);
+    assertEq(auctions[2].initAmount, 300e18);
-    assertEq(auctions[2].initAmount, 200e18);
+    assertEq(auctions[3].initAmount, 200e18);

    assertEq(auctions[0].floorAmount, 10e18);
-    assertEq(auctions[1].floorAmount, 15e18);
+    assertEq(auctions[2].floorAmount, 15e18);
-    assertEq(auctions[2].floorAmount, 10e18);
+    assertEq(auctions[3].floorAmount, 10e18);

    secondAuction.cancelAuction();

    auctions = factory.getActiveAuctionOrders(0, 100);

-    assertEq(auctions.length, 2);
+    assertEq(auctions.length, 3);
    assertEq(auctions[0].initAmount, 100e18);
-    assertEq(auctions[1].initAmount, 200e18);
+    assertEq(auctions[2].initAmount, 200e18);

    assertEq(auctions[0].floorAmount, 10e18);
-    assertEq(auctions[1].floorAmount, 10e18);
+    assertEq(auctions[2].floorAmount, 10e18);

    secondAuction = DutchAuction_veNFT(
        createAuctionInternal(300e18, 15e18, 106400)
    );

    auctions = factory.getActiveAuctionOrders(0, 100);

-    assertEq(auctions.length, 3);
+    assertEq(auctions.length, 4);
    assertEq(auctions[0].initAmount, 100e18);
-    assertEq(auctions[1].initAmount, 300e18);
+    assertEq(auctions[2].initAmount, 300e18);
-    assertEq(auctions[2].initAmount, 200e18);
+    assertEq(auctions[3].initAmount, 200e18);

    secondAuction.cancelAuction();
    DutchAuction_veNFT.dutchAuction_INFO[] memory historical = factory
        .getHistoricalAuctions(0, 100);

-    assertEq(historical.length, 4);
+    assertEq(historical.length, 5);

    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

Now, the following test can be added to `Auction.t.sol`:
```solidity
function testEditFloorPriceForSaleRevert() public {
    vm.startPrank(buyer);
    vm.expectRevert();
    SecondAuction.editFloorPrice(50e18);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

### Mitigation

In `editFloorPrice()`, there should be a case distinction for when it is called to change the floor price of a sale.
