# changeOwner() functions have no access control and does not transfer ownership to the new owner

### Summary

In DebitaV3Aggregator.sol, AuctionFactory.sol, buyOrderFactory.sol, a `changeOwner()` function is defined which is intended to change the owner field, which is a global storage variable.

There are 2 problems with this function
- there is  improper access control check on this function.
- This function does not actually modify the owner storage variable to the owner argument provided by the caller.

### Root Cause

In the `changeOwner()` function, the `owner` argument has the same variable name as the `owner` state variable. This results in **variable shadowing**. 

- The check `require(msg.sender == owner, "Invalid address")` is validating that the msg.sender address is equal to the address passed as the argument, not the current owner (state variable).
- `owner = owner` re-assigns parameter to itself. It does not actually modify the `owner` state variable

### Internal pre-conditions

- DebitaV3Aggregator.sol, AuctionFactory.sol, buyOrderFactory.sol contracts have been deployed
- `changeOwner()` function is called within first 6 hours of contract deployment

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- The address that deployed the contracts will be designated as the owner, and the ownership field will be immutable.
- If the current owner's address is compromised or ownership needs to be transferred within six hours, there will be no mechanism available to facilitate such a transfer.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a different name for the argument passed in to the `changeOwner()` function.

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
```
