# collateral left from partially defaulted loan will be stuck in the Loan contract

### Summary

When a loan has been partially defaulted i.e. the borrower did not repay the loan fully, the collateral tokens backing the already paid loans will be stuck in the contract indefinitely


### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan` when a loan is defaulted by the borrower the collateral can be claimed by the lenders based on their respective principle amount and ratio.

However when the loan is partially defaulted (i.e. the borrower repayed some lenders) the collateral left in the contract will stil be claimable by the unpaid lenders, but because the loan was partially defaulted not all the collateral can be claimed by the lenders.
The remaining collateral in this scenario will be stuck in the contract as it can neither be retrieved by the borrower or the protocol

### Mitigation

consider adding a sweep function that is only callable either by the borrower or the protocol when the total_paid loans(loans directly paid by the borrower) + total_claimed loans(defaulted loans that have claimed their collateral) = acceptedLoans length.

OR after every payment the equivalent collateral used is sent to the borrower
