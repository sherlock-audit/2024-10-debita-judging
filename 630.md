# Borrower can provide borrowers with a minimum of 4% collateral than they owe

### Summary

Firstly, let's understand that using NFT as a collaterall you can pay 2% less than if you just use tokens. This is clear from this check in [matchOffersV3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L564).
```solidity
        if (borrowInfo.isNFT) {
            require(
                amountOfCollateral <=
                    (borrowInfo.valuableAssetAmount * 10200) / 10000 &&
                    amountOfCollateral >=
                    (borrowInfo.valuableAssetAmount * 9800) / 10000,
                "Invalid collateral amount"
            );
        }
```

Further, after the borrower has already saved 2% collateral - he or she can simply not pay the debt and wait until the deadline has passed. 
Then all he has to do is put the NFT up for auction and buy it back from himself.

Let us realise that in this case lenders will also be underpaid by at least 2%, consider `Auction::buyNFT` specifically the moment of distribution of the purchase money.


```solidity
        uint fee;
        if (m_currentAuction.isLiquidation) {
            fee = auctionFactory(factory).auctionFee();
        } else {
            fee = auctionFactory(factory).publicAuctionFee();
        }

        // calculate fee
        uint feeAmount = (currentPrice * fee) / 10000;
        // get fee address
        address feeAddress = auctionFactory(factory).feeAddress();
        // Transfer liquidation token from the buyer to the owner of the auction
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
            msg.sender,
            s_ownerOfAuction,
            currentPrice - feeAmount
        );

        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
            msg.sender,
            feeAddress,
            feeAmount
        );
```
We see that in the case of liquidation - the minutes take 2% out of the money that goes to the seller (in the case of liquidation - Loan).

Thus, lenders receive at least 2% more (in case of instant sale, if you buy back NFT at a lower price - even more).

Borrowers can reduce collateral by 4% thereby exploiting lenders' loans


### Root Cause

I think this issue has several root causes that need to be fixed.

1) It is obviously a bad idea to allow borrowers to borrow with less collateral than they owe, even if it is by 2%

2) ProtocolFee on liquidations should either not be charged at all, as lenders are already on the losing end and the protocol makes their situation even worse, or it should be a surcharge on the purchase amount.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Borrower in one transaction creates a borrow order with the necessary parameters borrowCollateral, then in the same transaction match this order with lend orders, as a result paying 2% less collateral, then does not pay the debt, but only redeems its NFT from the auction immediately after its creation.

Borrower does not lose anywhere, while lenders lose completely.

### Impact

I think it is a combination of incorrect design choice protocol that allows the borrower to create deliberately disadvantageous LOANS for the lenders and exploit them. Medium.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Dont allow borrowers to pay less collateral than they should. If you use margin - only allow borrowers to borrow slightly more than less. (4% up, not 2% down and 2% up)

I would also advise taking the protocol commission when selling a liquidation NFT as a premium to the purchase price, not the other way round.
