# Chainlink's `latestRoundData` might return stale or incorrect results

### Summary

The protocol relies on Chainlinkâ€™s latestRoundData() in DebitaChainlink.sol::getThePrice() to fetch price data without completely validating its freshness. Although the quoteAnswer is checked to be greater than zero, however this alone is not sufficient. This incomplete validation could have the protocol produce incorrect values for very important functions in different places across the system especially within the DebitaV3Aggregator.sol::matchOffer() where the `getPriceFrom()` function which is the oracle implementation is called multiple times

### Root Cause

the getThePrice function https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L30-L47 lacks complete validation in these variables coming from latestRoundData() - roundId, updateTime and answeredInRound

Omitting these checks could lead to stale prices according to chainlink documentation [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data#overview)
