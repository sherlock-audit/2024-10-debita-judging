# `roundId` not checked in ChainLink price feed returns in `DebitaChainlink.getThePrice()` leading to stale prices

### Summary

`roundId` and `answeredInRound` not checked during [DebitaChainlink.getThePrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L30-#L47). 

`answeredInRound` must be checked against `roundId` to avoid stale price data. This stale price data leads to incorrect ratio calculations during matching offers in `MatchOfferV3()`.
