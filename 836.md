# claimDebt() transfers interest twice to lenders

### Summary

claimDebt() transfers interest twice to lenders

### Root Cause

In [_claimDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L288C1-L312C1), only principal should transfer but it transfers principal as well as interest and sets interest = 0 in memory. However, [claimInterest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L259C3-L269C6) also transfers interest to the lender, making twice interest transfer to the lender
```solidity
 function _claimDebt(uint index) internal {
        LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
        IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);

        infoOfOffers memory offer = m_loan._acceptedOffers[index];
        require(
            ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) == msg.sender,
            "Not lender"
        );
        require(offer.paid == true, "Not paid");
        require(offer.debtClaimed == false, "Already claimed");
        loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
        ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID);
        uint interest = offer.interestToClaim;
->      offer.interestToClaim = 0;

->      SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(offer.principle),
            msg.sender,
            interest + offer.principleAmount
        );

        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));
    }
```
```solidity
  function claimInterest(uint index) internal {
        IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);
        infoOfOffers memory offer = loanData._acceptedOffers[index];
->      uint interest = offer.interestToClaim;

        require(interest > 0, "No interest to claim");

        loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim = 0;
->      SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(offer.principle), msg.sender, interest);
        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

No

### External pre-conditions

No

### Attack Path

When a non perpetual lender will try to claim his principal and interest using claimDebt(), he will receive interest twice ie 1st in _claimDebt() & 2nd in claimInterest()

### Impact

borrower will loss money because lender are get paid twice.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Don't transfer interest amount in _claimDebt(), only transfer it in claimInterest()
