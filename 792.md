# Use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom` for transfering `ERC721` out to arbitrary address

### Summary

This is not safe to do for `ERC721` as it can cause issues. 

The recipient could have logic in the `onERC721Received()` function, which is only triggered in the `safeTransferFrom()` function and not in `transferFrom()`.

This can cause the received `ERC721` to get stuck because it was not received properly.
