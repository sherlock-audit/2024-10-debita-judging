# Missing updates of states when owner of NFT receipt making ERC721 related action such as transferring

### Summary

States variables in veNFTAerodrome should be take cares if there are ERC721 derived actions such as safeTransferFrom/transferFrom functions.

### Root Cause

The NFT receipt  contract derives from ERC721Enumerable contract which is decendant of ERC721.  The parent ERC721 contract contains public exposed methods such as transferFrom, safeTransferFrom functions. 
In the cases of receipt being transferred, the contract must take consideration of the states change such as balanceOfManager, indexPosition, ownenTokens.

### Attack Path

### Impact

The NFT receipt contract may have states inconsistence if there are transferring actions of receipts. And the vault manager should take special cares if the owner of the receipt has changed since transferring. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider overriding the transferFrom/safeTransferFrom function from ERC721.sol, alternatively, overriding _update function in Receipt-veNFT should works too.  Update state variables such ownedTokens, indexPosition, balanceOfManager, and handles the vault manager address in vault.
