# DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan can be DoSed due to underflow arithmetic

### Summary

`DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan` does an unchecked subtraction that can lead to an underflow under certain conditions DoSing the function i.e preventing the borrower from extending the loan


### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan` the function does the following 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L588-L592

```solidity
 uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;
 uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline -
                    alreadyUsedTime -
                    block.timestamp;
```
The issue is that `block.timestamp + alreadyUsedTime` can be greater than `offer.maxDeadline` which will cause the function to revert due to an underflow.

consider the following example:
for simplicity we'll assume the loan started at 0.
- m_loan.startedAt = 0
- offer.maxDeadline = 100
- block.timestamp = 70
- alreadyUsedTime = 70 - 0 = 70
- extendedTime = 100 - 70 - 70 = -40
The function will revert due to underflow

### Impact

Medium - borrower will be unable to extend their loan

### PoC

### Mitigation

The `extendedTime` is never used and should be removed
