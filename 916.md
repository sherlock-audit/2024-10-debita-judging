# Missing aggregatorContract validation allows uninitialized state in `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory` and `DebitaLendOfferFactory`

### Summary

The missing validation check for `aggregatorContract` will cause a functionality breakdown for borrowers and lenders as uninitialized instances default to address(0), which blocks operations restricted by the onlyAggregator modifier.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L75-L123) and 
[DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L124-L175), the `aggregatorContract` is declared but not validated before being used to initialize new instances of `DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation` or `DebitaLendOffer-Implementation`. As a result, it defaults to address(0) if not explicitly set.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `aggregatorContract` variable in the factory contracts must remain unset `(address(0))` before calling the `createBorrowOrder` or `createLendOrder` functions.
2. The `createBorrowOrder` or `createLendOrder` functions must be called without setting the `aggregatorContract`.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The borrowers and lenders are unable to utilize key functions restricted by the `onlyAggregator` modifier. This renders the system inoperable for affected operations, disrupting workflow and usability

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce validation of `aggregatorContract` before initializing new instances by adding a require statement in the `createBorrowOrder` and `createLendOrder` functions:

```solidity
require(aggregatorContract != address(0), "Aggregator contract not set");
```
This ensures that `aggregatorContract` is explicitly assigned a valid address before being used to initialize implementation contracts.
