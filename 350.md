# DebitaChainlink.getThePrice doesn't check for stale price

### Summary

`DebitaChainlink.getThePrice` function doesn't check for stale price. As result protocol can make decisions based on not up to date prices, which can cause loses.


### Root Cause

In the `DebitaChainlink` contract, the protocol uses a ChainLink aggregator to fetch the `latestRoundData()`, but there is no check if the return value indicates stale data. The below `DebitaChainlink.getThePrice` function doesn't check that price are up to date.

```solidity
    function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```

So it's possible that price is not outdated which can cause financial loses for protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Code will execute with prices that donâ€™t reflect the current pricing resulting in a potential financial loss for protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Need to check that price is not outdated by checking round timestamp. Add the folllowing check to the `getThePrice` function:

```solidity
        (, int price, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - 60 * 60 /* 1 hour */, "Stale price feed");
```
