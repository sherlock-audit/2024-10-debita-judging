# Debt repaying and liquidation mechanisms ignore the current token prices leading to loss of funds for lenders

### Summary

Current implementation of debt repaying and liquidation mechanisms in `DebitaV3Loan` does not account for principal and collateral tokens real-time dollar values. The protocol fails to handle volatile assets like wETH, wBTC or even AERO by assuming that their initial amount will have the same value during liquidation or debt repayment. Moreover, because live collateral token price checks are impossible there is no way to liquidate the loan before the deadline. These issues will lead to significant loss of funds for the lenders because depending on the price movement the borrowers might either decide to repay or get liquidated to avoid handling the bad debt. 

### Root Cause

Early liquidation is impossible - due to a lack of price checks, putting the lender in a losing position when the collateral does not hold its value. 

The `total` amount to repay in `payDebt()` is calculated based solely on `principalAmount` which was supplied to the borrower (and interest with fees):

Similarly, all "claimCollateral" functions calculate transfer amounts using data exclusively from LoanData struct populated during loan creation in `matchOffersV3()`. 

Borrowers can easily end the loan by repayment, the lender cannot liquidate early.

### Internal pre-conditions

- there are loans which use any assets other than stablecoins as principle and/or collateral tokens


### External pre-conditions

- significant price movement occurs during loan's duration ( considering it's most likely on a multiple-day timeframe, it's inevitable )


### Attack Path

Malicious user *could* try to exploit predictable price movement for their own financial gain, but it's irrelevant as the loss of funds occurs even between honest actors as well.

### Impact

Significant loss of funds for both borrowers and lenders depending on the token price movement direction. 

Examples:

Liquidation issue - lender's loss due to undercollateralization without liquidation:
1. A loan is created where 1 wBTC ( at a price $100,000 ) is used as collateral in exchange for 100,000 USDC. The duration of the loan is 30 days. Assume 0 fees and 0% APR for simplicity.
2. After 30 days the wBTC price has fallen to $80,000. The lender had no way to liquidate undercollateralized loan.
3. Borrower does not repay the debt leaving with $20,000 worth of lender's USDC.

Debt repayment issue - lender's loss due to repaying now overcollateralized loan with initial amounts:
1. A loan created where 10,000 USDC is used as collateral in exchange for 4 ETH at a price of $2,500. The duration of the loan is 30 days. Assume 0 fees and 0% APR for simplicity.
2. After 30 days ETH price falls to $2,000. The borrower has to pay off 4 ETH worth $8,000 to get 10,000 USDC at the cost of the lender.
3. Borrower repays their debt receving 10,000 USDC back and leaving the lender with $8,000 worth of ETH.

### Mitigation

When volatile assets are involved, ensure that the price movements of the collateral and principle tokens are tracked to calculate a health factor of the loan. Allow early liquidations in an event of undercollateralization and make sure debt is repaid with the amount of principle adjusted by the dollar value. The current implementation will not provide safe conditions for mid or long-term loans.
