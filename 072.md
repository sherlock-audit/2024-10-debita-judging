# Attacker Will Exploit Ownership Transfer Bug to Prevent Ownership Change

### Summary

By exploiting the unchanged ownership, the attacker can perform malicious actions such as manipulating auctions, lending, and borrowing.
The global variable does not change by changeowner function because the global and local variable's names are same.

```solidity
 owner = owner
```

### Root Cause

```solidity
 owner = owner
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L189
```solidity
owner = owner
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L221
```solidity
owner = owner
```

### Internal pre-conditions

The attacker can implement the contract without changing the ownership.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users interacting with the contract might expect that ownership can be transferred following the function's name and intent. When it fails to behave as expected, it could lead to a loss of trust in the contract and its administrators.
If the owner needs to delegate or transfer control of the contract for operational or security reasons, they cannot do so.
This limitation could hinder the flexibility and lifecycle management of the contract.
### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It has to be correct.
```solidity
   function changeOwner(address newowner) public {
       ...
        owner = newowner;
    }
```
