# Borrower will grief lenders by extending the lock of veNFTs when loan defaults

### Summary

When a loan that is using a veNFT as collateral defaults, the borrower can grief the lenders by extending the lock the the maximum duration allowed. 

### Root Cause

The root cause is that the borrower of a loan is allowed to extend the lock duration of a veNFT when the loan is defaulted, griefing the lenders.

### Internal pre-conditions

- There must be a loan using veAERO as collateral and the loan must default.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A malicious borrower gets a veNFT that is locked for some amount of time (e.g. 2 months).
2. The borrower locks that veNFT into a receipt to use it as collateral for a loan
3. A loan is created with that veNFT as collateral. 
4. Time passes and the loan defaults.
5. The borrower then calls `extendMultiple` to extend the loan duration of the veNFT with the maximum duration allowed (4 years for Aerodrome and 26 weeks for Equalizer).
6. When the veNFT is auctioned, the final price for that veNFT will likely be lower because the lock amount is now higher. 

### Impact

A borrower of a defaulted loan can extend the lock duration of the veNFT collateral, therefore griefing the lenders because they will receive less funds for the auction. 

It's complicated to theorize how much the value of a veNFT will decrease if it's locked for 4 years or for 2 months but it's safe to assume that will cause some loss of funds, even if constrained; hence the medium severity.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, is recommended to take the following precautions before allowing a manager of a veNFT to increase the lock amount:
- Don't allow to increase the lock duration if the loan is defaulted.
- Don't allow to increase the lock duration for a period higher than the loan duration.
