# `Auction.sol` `tickPerBlock` zero division will prevent user from edit floor price later

### Summary

Auction tick per block can be zero during init. This will later cause zero division error when user call `editFloorPrice()`.
This will only happen if user set init price equal to floor price.

### Root Cause

- Possible Division by zero value here: <https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L206-L207>
- `tickPerBlock` created during init: <https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L93>
- `tickPerBlock == 0` when `curedInitAmount == curedFloorAmount`. Aka, user set init price same floor price. Duration must be non-zero value.
- Auction Factory allow user to init price same as floor price and set duration be anything. <https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L80-L90>


### Internal pre-conditions

Here is an sample auction parameters from user
- Init price = 100e18
- Floor price = 100e18
- duration = 1 days

### External pre-conditions

- User create auction with above parameters.
- Then change floor price after sometimes due to stale auction.

### Attack Path

- Because original tickPerBlock is zero, when edit floor price later it will revert with division by zero.


### Impact

User allowed to set floor price same as init price but cannot edit floor price later, despite duration exist.

Require user to cancel auction and recreate new auction. Cost user time and gas.



### PoC
Same as attack path

### Mitigation

Throw error when tick speed is zero when edit floor price, to prevent user from changing tick speed later.
