# USDT incompatible with DebitaIncentives contract

### Summary

The protocol intends to support USDT, but uses the IERC20 interface in the `DebitaIncentives` contract to:
1. `transferFrom()` the incentive depositer to the incentives contract in `incentivizePair()`
2. `transfer()` incentives from the incentives contract to the incentive receiver in `claimIncentives()`

Both transfers will always revert when the incentive token is USDT.



### Root Cause

The IERC20 interface expects a bool return value, but USDT doesn't return a bool which causes the revert.

Here's the problematic line in `incentivizePair()`:

Here's the problematic line in `claimIncentives()`:

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. User wants to use USDT as a token incentive

### Attack Path

1. A user wants to use USDT as an incentive token
2. They call `incentivizePair()`, but the call reverts due to the root cause mentioned above.
3. Although `claimIncentives` would also revert when USDT is the incentive, this would be impossible because there would never be any USDT to claim because noone can call `incentivizePair` with USDT.

### Impact

USDT cannot be used as an incentive token.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the safe transfer library like you've done with all the other contracts.
