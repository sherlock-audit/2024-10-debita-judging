# Matching some lend orders can be blocked

### Summary

The `deleteOrder()` function in the `DebitaLendOffer` contract is used to delete borrow orders from index of the factory contract and is callable by a legit lend order.
The `deleteOrder()` function reduces `activeOrdersCount` by 1 each time it is called per user
The problem is that `deleteOrder()` can be called twice per user and this can lead to a DOS when matching honest lend orders

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207-L220

The problem is possible because
- `addFunds()` can be called on orders that are not active
-  `isLendOrderLegit[msg.sender]` is `true` even when an order has been deleted form the factory


```solidity
File: DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol
207:     function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder {

/////SNIP  .......
216: 
217:         allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);
218: 
219:  @>     activeOrdersCount--;
220:     }

```

An active lender had the liberty to reduce `activeOrdersCount` by 2 instead of just 1
- first when `acceptLendingOffer()` is called on a completely filled no perpetual order, `deleteOrder()` is called

```solidity
File: DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol
109:     function acceptLendingOffer(
110:         uint amount
111:     ) public onlyAggregator nonReentrant onlyAfterTimeOut {
/////SNIP
127:         // offer has to be accepted 100% in order to be deleted
128:         if (
129:    @>       lendInformation.availableAmount == 0 && !m_lendInformation.perpetual
130:         ) {
131:             isActive = false;
132:             IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
133:    @>       IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
134:         } else {
135:             IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
136:         }
137: 
138:         // emit accepted event on factory
139:     }


144:     function cancelOffer() public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
////SNIP    .......
148:         require(availableAmount > 0, "No funds to cancel");
149:         isActive = false;
150: 
............
157:   @>    IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
158:         // emit canceled event on factory
159:     }

```

- second even if the order is completely filled, he can call `addFunds()` to ensure `lendInformation.availableAmount > 0` and then call `cancelOffer()`

using these two instances above, a malicious lender can cause a DOS preventing other lender's non perpetual orders to be matched as explained in the _Attack path_ section.

Also, the lenders cannot cancel their orders because `activeOrdersCount` = 0

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- there are 10 `activeOrdersCount` (all of them non perpetual)
- Alice creates a non perpetual lend order making `activeOrdersCount` = 11
- all 11 orders get fully matched thus:
    - `activeOrdersCount` = 0`
    - `lendInformation.availableAmount != 0` for all the orders
    - all orders are deleted from the factory's index
- Bob creates a non perpetual lend order waiting to be matched because there are currently no borrow orders `activeOrdersCount` = 1
- Alice calls `addFunds()` with 1 wei of the `lendInformation.principle` token
- Alice calls `cancelOffer()` and because `lendInformation.availableAmount ` = 0 the call succeeds and `deleteOrder()` is called again making `activeOrdersCount` = 0
- Borrow orders are now available to fully match Bob's lend order such that `lendInformation.availableAmount ` = 0
- Bobs pending order cannot be completely matched by the current borrow offers, `acceptLendingOffer()` will revert because it calls `deleteOrder()` when a non perpetual order os fully filled



### Impact

- lend offers cannot be filled
- lenders funds are stuck without a way to withdraw
- `changePerpetual()` cannot be called for non perpetual orders that were partially filled

In a nutshel, a DOS and stuck funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Once offers are deleted form the lend offer factory ensure the `deleteOrder()` function marks them as illegitimate as shown below

```diff
File: DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol
207:     function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder {
208:         uint index = LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder];
209:         LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder] = 0;
210: 
211:         // switch index of the last borrow order to the deleted borrow order
212:         allActiveLendOrders[index] = allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1];
213:         LendOrderIndex[allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]] = index;
214: 
215:         // take out last borrow order
216: 
217:         allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);
+218:      isLendOrderLegit[msg.sender] = false;
219:         activeOrdersCount--;
220:     }

```
