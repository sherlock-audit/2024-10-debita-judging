# Incorrect implementation of checkSequencer on Arbitrum

### Summary

Incorrect implementation of checkSequencer on Arbitrum due to missing zero check of ```startedAt```, this will lead to improper GracePeriod check
```solidity
 // Make sure the grace period has passed after the
        // sequencer is back up.
        uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt; //@audit-issue no zero check! 
        if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
            revert GracePeriodNotOver();
        }
```
If startedAt = 0, the check will pass regardless of sequencer uptime

### Root Cause

No zero check on ```startedAt```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Uninitialized sequencer uptime

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Incorrect validation of sequencer uptime, causing ```checkSequencer()``` not to revert when it ought to.

### PoC

https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#:~:text=startedAt%3A%20This%20timestamp,the%20dataFeed%20object.

> startedAt: This timestamp indicates when the sequencer feed changed status. When the sequencer comes back up after an outage, wait for the GRACE_PERIOD_TIME to pass before accepting answers from the data feed. Subtract startedAt from block.timestamp and revert the request if the result is less than the GRACE_PERIOD_TIME.

>The startedAt variable returns 0 only on Arbitrum when the Sequencer Uptime contract is not yet initialized. For L2 chains other than Arbitrum, startedAt is set to block.timestamp on construction and startedAt is never 0. After the feed begins rounds, the startedAt timestamp will always indicate when the sequencer feed last changed status.
If the sequencer is up and the GRACE_PERIOD_TIME has passed, the function retrieves the latest answer from the data feed using the dataFeed object.

Since there are plans to deploy on Arbitrum, the check is necessary for correct validation.

Q: On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?

### Mitigation

Include a zero check on ```statedAt``` to ensure proper validation of grace period time.
