# Undesired liuquidatio because of an invalid check while extending the Loan.



### Summary

Users should be allowed to execute extendLoan thorugh out loan duration which starts from `loan.startedAt` untill `nextDeadline()`.

But users cannot execute extendLoan() when the timestamp is equal to `nextDeadline()`.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L554-L557
 ```solidity
    require(
            nextDeadline() > block.timestamp, //@audit >= ?
            "Deadline passed to extend loan"
        );
```
Due to this missing `equalTo` check, users are restrcted from extending the loan at the end of the `deadline()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact
 
 A borrower cannot stop their collatteral getting liquidated by extending their loanDuration at the end of deadline.


### PoC
_No response_

### Mitigation

 ```solidity
    require(
            nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp, 
            "Deadline passed to extend loan"
        );
```
