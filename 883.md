# Borrowers and lenders are lose incentive tokens

### Summary

A lender can create an offer with any principal token and accepted collaterals, while a borrower creates an offer with collateral and accepted principals. The owner of the `DebitaIncentives.sol` contract decides whether a principal-collateral pair is whitelisted. When the `updateFunds` function is called from the aggregator contract and one of the pairs is not whitelisted, the function will exit, causing some borrowers and lenders to not receive incentive tokens.

### Root Cause

In [updateFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L313-L318) there is a check that exit function:
```solidity
bool validPair = isPairWhitelisted[informationOffers[i].principle][
                collateral
            ];
            if (!validPair) {
-->             return;
            }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Lender_1 creates offer with principle - ETH, collaterals - USDT, USDC, DAI
2. Lender_2 creates offer with principle - LINK, collaterals - USDT, DAI
3. Borrower_1 creates offer with collateral - USDT, principle - ETH, LINK.
4. The owner of `DebitaIncentives` calls the `whitelistCollateral` function and sets the ETH-USDT pair to true.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

5. The caller of the `matchOffersV3` function will match the [LINK-USDT] and [ETH-USDT] pairs. However, since the [LINK-USDT] pair isn't whitelisted, the call to `updateFunds()` will result in Lender_1 not receiving incentive tokens.
```solidity
bool validPair = isPairWhitelisted[informationOffers[i].principle][
                collateral
            ];
            if (!validPair) {
-->             return;  /// exit function cause [LINK-USDT] pair isn't whitelisted
            }
```

### Impact

Borrowers and lenders won't receive incentive tokens

### Mitigation

Consider changing `updateFunds` function:
```diff
            bool validPair = isPairWhitelisted[informationOffers[i].principle][
                collateral
            ];
            if (!validPair) {
-                return;
+               continue;
            }
```
