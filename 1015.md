# Risk of Fund Loss Due to Unexpected Withdrawals

### Summary

In the provided contract, users risk losing funds due to an issue in the `deposit` function where the `require` statement relies on balance checks after transferring tokens. If another user or transaction initiates a withdrawal or reduces the contractâ€™s balance before the `balanceAfter` is read, the balance difference may fall below the expected `amount`, causing the `require` statement to fail. This failure reverts the transaction and rolls back any state changes within the contract, but **does not revert the external token transfer**, as it is executed by the external `ERC20` token contract. As a result, the tokens transferred into the contract during `safeTransferFrom` remain locked, leaving the sender unable to recover them unless a specific recovery mechanism exists.
