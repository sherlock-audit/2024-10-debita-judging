# DoS attack on loop in a loop

### Summary

The loop in a loop has no restriction or limit. And the gas cost may be huge to make the contract not service.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/veNFTAerodrome.sol#L160-L171

Here the length of token and length of token[] are both under no limitation and the token is also not deduplicated. If the attacker has the same token for many times and the loop will be called many times and cost much gas to a DoS attack.Here should add limitation and has deduplication of token.
