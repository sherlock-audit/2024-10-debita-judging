# claimCollateralAsLender() burns the lender's ownership even if they did not claim the collateral in claimCollateralAsNFTLender()

### Summary

In some cases, claimCollateralAsNFTLender() will not transfer the collateral but will still burn the lender's ownership.

### Root Cause

In DebitaV3Loan.sol claimCollateralAsLender() burns the ownership of a lender even if they didn't receive the collateral because it does not revert. So anytime there are more than 1 lenders in a loan and there is no auction initialized on the collateral, lenders calling claimCollateralAsLender() will just get their ownership burnt and will have no way of retrieving it.
```solidity
    function claimCollateralAsLender(uint index) external nonReentrant {
        LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
        infoOfOffers memory offer = m_loan._acceptedOffers[index];
        IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);
        require(
            ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) == msg.sender,
            "Not lender"
        );
        // burn ownership
>       ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID);
        uint _nextDeadline = nextDeadline();

        require(offer.paid == false, "Already paid");
        require(
            _nextDeadline < block.timestamp && _nextDeadline != 0,
            "Deadline not passed"
        );
        require(offer.collateralClaimed == false, "Already executed");

        // claim collateral
        if (m_loan.isCollateralNFT) {
            claimCollateralAsNFTLender(index);
        } else {
            ...
        }
        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));
    }

    function claimCollateralAsNFTLender(uint index) internal returns (bool) {
        LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
        infoOfOffers memory offer = m_loan._acceptedOffers[index];
        loanData._acceptedOffers[index].collateralClaimed = true;

        if (m_loan.auctionInitialized) {
            ...
        } else if (
            m_loan._acceptedOffers.length == 1 && !m_loan.auctionInitialized
        ) {
            ...
        }
        return false;
    }
