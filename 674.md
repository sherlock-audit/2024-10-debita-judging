# Dynamic fee parameter dependency will cause unpredictable cost fluctuations for borrowers

### Summary

Dynamic dependency on `AggregatorContract` parameters (`feePerDay`, `minFEE`, and `maxFEE`) will cause unpredictable fee and interest adjustments for borrowers and lenders. This occurs because the contract does not save these parameters during loan initialization, allowing the Aggregator admin to modify them at any time. This introduces trust issues and potential exploitation.

### Root Cause

The `extendLoan` function calculates fees dynamically based on the **current state** of the `AggregatorContract` parameters (`feePerDay`, `minFEE`, and `maxFEE`). These parameters are not stored in the `LoanData` during initialization, leaving loans vulnerable to changes by the Aggregator admin after creation.

### Attack Path

The Aggregator admin can:
1. **Increase `feePerDay`**, `minFEE`, or `maxFEE` to extract additional fees from borrowers during the loan extension.
2. **Decrease these parameters** to reduce lender returns, potentially favoring specific actors.
3. Exploit the lack of immutability in loan terms to create arbitrary, unfavorable conditions.


### Impact

Unpredictable fee and interest fluctuations for:
1. **Borrowers**: Could face higher-than-expected fees or interest rates due to parameter changes.
2. **Lenders**: Might receive reduced returns or suffer from trust issues in the protocol.

### Mitigation

1. Add the following fields to the `LoanData` struct:
   ```solidity
   uint savedFeePerDay;
   uint savedMinFEE;
   uint savedMaxFEE;
   ```
2. Save these parameters during loan initialization in the `initialize` function:
   ```solidity
   loanData.savedFeePerDay = Aggregator(AggregatorContract).feePerDay();
   loanData.savedMinFEE = Aggregator(AggregatorContract).minFEE();
   loanData.savedMaxFEE = Aggregator(AggregatorContract).maxFEE();
   ```
3. Use the saved parameters instead of dynamically fetching them in the `extendLoan` function:
   ```solidity
   uint feePerDay = loanData.savedFeePerDay;
   uint minFEE = loanData.savedMinFEE;
   uint maxFee = loanData.savedMaxFEE;
   ```
