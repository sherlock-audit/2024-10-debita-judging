# Users can deposit veNFTs with ID 0 causing permanent lock of veNFTs

### Summary

The lack of validation for veNFT ID 0 in the deposit function will cause permanent fund lock for users as users can deposit veNFTs with ID 0 which will later fail withdrawal validation checks.

### Root Cause

function deposit: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/Receipt-veNFT.sol#L63
function withdraw: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/veNFTAerodrome.sol#L93
In Receipt-veNFT.sol (deposit function), there is no validation to prevent NFT ID 0 from being deposited, while in veNFTAerodrome.sol (withdraw function) explicitly checks and reverts if attached_NFTID == 0.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls deposit() function with an array containing veNFT ID 0
2. The deposit succeeds as there is no validation check for veNFT ID 0
3. A receipt is minted to the user and the veNFT is transferred to the vault
4. When trying to withdraw, the transaction will always revert due to the check `require(attached_NFTID != 0, "No attached nft")`
5. The NFT becomes permanently locked in the vault as it can never be withdrawn

### Impact

The users suffer permanent loss of their veNFTs  if they deposit veNFTs with ID 0.
