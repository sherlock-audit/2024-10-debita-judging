# Incorrect Decimal Handling in MixOracle Price Calculation

### Summary

The incorrect decimal handling in `MixOracle.sol` will cause significant price discrepancies as the contract fails to properly scale token decimals when calculating prices from Tarot Oracle TWAP and Pyth oracle feeds, which leads to severely undervalued or overvalued asset prices.


### Root Cause

In [MixOracle.sol#L40-L95](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3-endless-c/tree/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/MixOracle/MixOracle.sol#L47-100), the `getThePrice` function incorrectly handles decimals in multiple places:

1. When calculating `amountOfAttached`:
```solidity
int amountOfAttached = int(
    (((2 ** 112)) * (10 ** decimalsToken1)) / twapPrice112x112
);
```

2. When calculating the final price:
```solidity
uint price = (uint(amountOfAttached) * uint(attachedTokenPrice)) /
    (10 ** decimalsToken1);
```

The calculation fails to properly account for:
- The scaling factor (2^112) from Tarot Oracle
- The different decimal places between token0 and token1
- The additional scaling applied by Tarot Oracle (10^12)

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Tarot Oracle needs to return a TWAP price for a token pair with different decimals (e.g., WETH/USDT with 18/6 decimals)
2. The price ratio between tokens needs to be significant enough to make the decimal scaling error apparent
3. The Pyth oracle price feed for the attached token needs to be active and returning prices


### Attack Path

### Impact

Medium. The incorrect decimal handling leads to wrong price calculations that could significantly impact protocol operations relying on these price feeds.

### PoC

Consider a WETH/USDT pair where:
- WETH (token0): 18 decimals
- USDT (token1): 6 decimals
- Pool reserves: 100 WETH and 300,000 USDT

As demonstrated in the Python POC:
```python
def getPrice_USDT():
    nt0 = 100  # token 0 (WETH) reserves
    nt1 = 300000  # token 1 (USDT) reserves
    nt0_decimal = 10**18
    nt1_decimal = 10**6
    
    twapPrice112x112 = (nt1 * nt1_decimal) * 2**112 / nt0 * nt0_decimal 
    
    amount_of_attached = (2**112 * 10**6) / ((nt1 * nt1_decimal) * 2**112 / nt0 * nt0_decimal)
    amount_of_attached = nt0 * 10**18 / nt1  # Simplified after cancellation
    
    attachedTokenPrice = 3000 
    decimalsToken1 = 6
    price = (amount_of_attached) * attachedTokenPrice / (10**decimalsToken1)
    
    print(f"more human readable price: {price /10**8}$")
```

This shows that the current implementation:
1. Incorrectly cancels out the 2^112 scaling
2. Doesn't properly handle the decimal difference between token0 and token1
3. Results in a significantly wrong price due to improper scaling

### Mitigation

Modify the price calculation in `getThePrice` to properly handle decimals
