# Principle Incentive DoS Because of Bribe Token Indexing

### Summary
Token indexing check will cause a denial of service impact for protocol users as malicious actors will block legitimate principle incentivization by exploiting the first-mover advantage in bribe token registration.

### Root Cause
In `DebitaIncentives.sol` at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L257 the choice to use mapping for `hasBeenIndexedBribe` that only tracks epoch and incentive token (without principle) is a mistake as it prevents multiple principles from using the same bribe token within an epoch.

```solidity
mapping(uint => mapping(address => bool)) public hasBeenIndexedBribe;
// Mapping: epoch => incentivizeToken => bool
```

### Internal pre-conditions
_No response_

### Attack Path
1. Attacker identifies a commonly used bribe token (e.g., USDC) and a target epoch
2. Attacker calls `incentivizePair()` with:
   - A principle token
   - The identified bribe token
   - A minimal amount
   - The target epoch
3. `hasBeenIndexedBribe[epoch][incentivizeToken]` is set to true
4. When legitimate users try to incentivize different principles with the same bribe token:
   - The `hasBeenIndexedBribe` check fails
   - Their tokens are transferred but not properly indexed
   - The incentive becomes unclaimable
   
### Impact
The affected users suffer a total loss of deposited bribe tokens when attempting to incentivize principles after the attacker has claimed the token for an epoch. Additionally, the ability to properly incentivize principles using popular bribe tokens is permanently blocked for that epoch, disrupting the protocol's incentive mechanism.
