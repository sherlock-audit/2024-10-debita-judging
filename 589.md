# Incentives Locked Due to Inactivity

### Summary

In [`DebitaIncentives::incentivizePair`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L225-L231), anyone can incentivize any amount of incentive for a specific principle when it is borrowed or lent during a specific epoch.

The problem arises when no activity occurs for that principle within an epoch (a 14-day period) that has been incentivized. In such a case, the [`updateFunds()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L306-L311) function will not be called, and the [mappings used to split the incentives](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L323-L331) will not be updated. Consequently, the incentives will be permanently locked in the `DebitaIncentives` contract, as there is no way to recover the incentives through `claimIncentives()` or any other function.

### Root Cause

- The decision not to integrate a recovery function for the owner of the incentives, in cases where no activity occurs with an incentivized principle during a specific epoch.

### Internal pre-conditions

No lending activity with any incentivized token occurs during a 14-day period.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

#### Bob incentivizes:
- **Principle**: LINK
- **Mode**: Lend
- **Epoch**: 18
- **Incentive amount**: 1,000 DAI

During the entire epoch 18, no one lends LINK. As a result, the following mappings are not updated:
- `lentAmountPerUserPerEpoch`
- `totalUsedTokenPerEpoch`
- `borrowAmountPerEpoch`

These mappings are essential in the `claimIncentives()` function to calculate the percentage of incentives ([`percentageLent`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L161) and [`percentageBorrow`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L175)) allocated to corresponding users. 

However, as there was no activity, even the owner cannot retrieve the incentives through `claimIncentives()` because all resulting percentages will be zero.

### Impact

Incentives locked forever into the incentives contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

#### Add a Function for Recovery of Incentives if No Activity Was Done

- When a user incentivizes a pair, save that user as the owner of the incentives just transferred.
- Add a function to recover the incentives using the saved owner. Requirements:
  - The epoch must be finished.
  - No activity should have occurred during the epoch. Use the `totalUsedTokenPerEpoch` mapping to verify if any activity took place.
