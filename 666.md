the bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch is meant to increase for the principle token not the incentive, this means that everytime the principle token is not the incentive, it wont increase in the right way and the new incentive token will override the last one as lastamount will be the same 
### Root Cause

wrong state update 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

the function getBribesPerEpoch will return the address(0) for some of the tokens as there wont be anything stored at some amounts 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

the line of code should be written bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch[epoch][principle]++ to ensure the right number of tokens are stored
