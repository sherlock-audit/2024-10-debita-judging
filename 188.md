# Loss of Accrued Interest Due to interestToClaim Overwrite in Non-Perpetual Loans

### Summary

When borrowers extend a loan and repay it, lenders of non-perpetual loans can lose unclaimed accrued interest. This occurs because the interestToClaim value is overwritten during the payDebt function, causing funds to remain stuck in the contract. If lenders have already claimed their interest before repayment, they are unaffected, as the interestToClaim value would be 0. However, unclaimed interest is effectively erased.

### Root Cause

If lender extends a loan initial interet is added to `interestToClaim` for non-perpetrual loans.
```solidity
                if (
                    lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer
                ) {
                    IERC20(offer.principle).approve(
                        address(lendOffer),
                        interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita
                    );
                    lendOffer.addFunds(
                        interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita
                    );
                } else {
                    loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestToClaim +=
                        interestOfUsedTime -
                        interestToPayToDebita;
                }
```

The payDebt function overwrites the interestToClaim field without accounting for previously accrued interest, particularly for non-perpetual loans where the lender has not yet claimed their interest.

```solidity
                if (
                    lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer
                ) {
                    IERC20(offer.principle).approve(
                        address(lendOffer),
                        interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita
                    );
                    lendOffer.addFunds(
                        interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita
                    );
                } else {
                    loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestToClaim +=
                        interestOfUsedTime -
                        interestToPayToDebita;
                }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The loan must be non-perpetual.
2. The borrower must call extendLoan, which calculates and assigns accrued interest to interestToClaim.
3. The lender must not have claimed their accrued interest after the extension.
4. The borrower must call payDebt, which overwrites the accrued interest in interestToClaim.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Overwriting interestToClaim disregards previously accrued interest calculated during extendLoan. This results in a loss of funds for the lender and causes the unclaimed interest to remain stuck in the contract.

```solidity
    function testInterestOverwritten() public {
        MatchOffers();
        uint[] memory indexes = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
        indexes[0] = 0;
        
        vm.startPrank(borrower);
        AEROContract.approve(address(DebitaV3LoanContract), 100e18);
                vm.warp(block.timestamp + 96400);
        
        // Extend the loan which should accumulate interest
        // Since lender is not perpetual, this increases interestToClaim
        DebitaV3LoanContract.extendLoan();

        // Get loan data to check initial interest accumulation
        DebitaV3Loan.LoanData memory _loanData1 = DebitaV3LoanContract.getLoanData();
        uint256 initialInterestToClaim = _loanData1._acceptedOffers[0].interestToClaim;

        // Verify initial interest calculations
        assertGt(initialInterestToClaim, 0, "Initial interest should be greater than 0");
        assertEq(calculateInterest(0), 0, "No new interest should be calculated at this point");

        // Advance time significantly to accumulate more interest
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 8530000);

        // Calculate new interest for the additional time period
        uint256 newInterestToPay = calculateInterest(0);

        DebitaV3LoanContract.payDebt(indexes);

        // Get updated loan data
        DebitaV3Loan.LoanData memory _loanData2 = DebitaV3LoanContract.getLoanData();
        uint256 finalInterestToClaim = _loanData2._acceptedOffers[0].interestToClaim;
        uint fee = (newInterestToPay * 1500) / 10000;
        // Verify that final interest includes both initial and new interest
        assertEq(finalInterestToClaim, newInterestToPay + initialInterestToClaim -fee,"Final interest should equal sum of initial and new interest");
    }
```

### Mitigation

Modify the payDebt function to preserve and increase the interestToClaim value rather than overwriting it
