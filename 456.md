# No check for sequencer uptime can lead to dutch auctions executing at bad prices

### Summary

When purchasing from dutch auctions on L2s there is no considering of sequencer uptime. When the sequencer is down, all transactions must originate from the L1. The issue with this is that these transactions use an aliased address. Since the set token contracts don't implement any way for these aliased addressed to interact with the protocol, no transactions can be processed during this time even with force L1 inclusion. If the sequencer goes offline during the the auction period then the auction will continue to decrease in price while the sequencer is offline. Once the sequencer comes back online, users will be able to buy tokens from these auctions at prices much lower than market price.

Thus, a contract  [`DutchAuction_veNFT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L31) that sells NFT by the DutchAuction method when the sequencer falls may sell NFT for a price below market.

Given that this contract is used not only for free sale of NFT by users, but also to liquidate positions where NFT is used as a Collateral - such behavior would be detrimental to all parties to the protocol.



### Root Cause

Protocol does not check sequencer uptime for Dutch Auction.

### Internal pre-conditions

The user must put NFT up for sale or Loan with collateral NFT should liquidate NFT by auction.

### External pre-conditions

Sequencer falls

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Auction will sell/buy assets at prices much lower/higher than market price leading to large losses for the set token. Liquidation functionality for Loans with NFT collateral will also be damaged.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check sequencer uptime and invalidate the auction if the sequencer was ever down during the auction period
