# A borrower may pay more interest that he has specified, if orders are matched by a malicious actor

### Summary

In the ``DebitaV3Aggregator.sol`` contract, anybody can match borrow and lend orders by calling the [matchOffersV3()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274-L647) function. When borrowers create their borrow orders they specify a maximum APR they are willing to pay. However the [matchOffersV3()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274-L647) function allows the caller to specify an array of 29 different lend orders to be matched against each borrow offer. Another important parameter is the ``uint[] memory lendAmountPerOrder`` which specifies the amount of principal tokens each lend order will provide. A malicious user can provide smaller amounts for a part of the ``lendAmountPerOrder`` params, such that the borrower pays a higher APR on this amounts. The problem arises due to the fact that there are no minimum restrictions on the ``lendAmountPerOrder`` (except it being bigger than 0), and the fact that solidity rounds down on division. 
```solidity
uint updatedLastApr = (weightedAverageAPR[principleIndex] * amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex]) / (amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex] + lendAmountPerOrder[i]);
uint newWeightedAPR = (lendInfo.apr * lendAmountPerOrder[i]) / amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex];
weightedAverageAPR[principleIndex] = newWeightedAPR + updatedLastApr;
```
As we can see form the code snippet above, when the ``newWeightedAPR`` is calculated if the APR specified by the lender of a lend order and the lendAmountPerOrder product is less than the amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex], 0 will be added to the weightedAverageAPR for the borrow order. Now if the borrower has requested a lot of funds, paying much bigger APR than the one he specified on  **2% - 3%** on those funds results in big loss for the borrower. 
Let's consider a simplified example of the PoC provided in the PoC section
 - A borrower creates a borrow offer for  **500_000e6 USDC**, with  **WETH** as collateral, a  **5% APR**, and a ratio of **2_500e6 USDC** for  **1e18 WETH**, for a duration of  **150 days**.
 - There might be several lenders that have created orders that match the params of the borrow order, for simplicity consider there is one lender - LenderA that matches the params, and he has provided  **495_000e6 USDC** as available principal, or is left with such amount, after his lend order was matched with other borrow orders. 
 - Now the person who is matching the orders can either create a lend offer with higher APR, or find another lender who provides an accepted principal by the borrower, and accepts the offered collateral, but has a higher APR than the one specified by the borrower. 
 - We assumer the user matching the orders creates a lend order with  **10% APR**, which is double the APR specified by the borrower (instead of only hurting the borrower by making him pay more interest, he is also going to profit).
 - When matching the orders, the user will first provide a lendAmountPerOrder of **200_000e6 + 1** from the lend order of LenderA, and then 28 more lendAmountPerOrder **200e6** each from the lend order with 10% APR
 - Since the max length of the lendAmountPerOrder is 29, for a bigger impact the malicious user will call the [matchOffersV3()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274-L647) function once more, this time setting the first lendAmountPerOrder to be **286_391e6 + 1**, and the next amounts for the lendAmountPerOrder will be **286e6**
 - This results in two separate loan orders, however they are both for the same borrow order, in this way the borrower will have to pay **5% APR** on **486_391e6 + 2 USDC**, and **10% APR** on **13_608e6 USDC**. The borrower will have to pay double the APR he specified on **~2.72%** of the funds he received(excluding the Debita protocol withheld fees, on which the borrower still pays interest). This results in the borrower paying **10_553_568_492 USDC** instead of **10_273_952_054 USDC**, which is a difference of **279_616_438 ~279e6 USDC**, for the 150 day duration of the loan. Note that the above calculation are provided in the PoC below. 
 
 In conclusion this results in the borrower paying double the APR he specified on part of the principal he received. Keep in mind that the collateral is worth more than the principal, so the borrower is incentivized to repay his debt back, for some reason Debita has decided to not utilize liquidation if the nominal dollar value drops below the dollar nominal value of the principal, and rely only on loan duration for loan liquidations. Also in the above scenario the malicious actor profited by collecting a bigger interest rate on his assets. 

### Root Cause

In the [matchOffersV3()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274-L647) function, there are no limitations on who can call the function, and on the provided parameters. 

### Internal pre-conditions
Borrower creates a big borrow order

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact
When borrow orders are big (there are numerous cases where people have taken out millions in loans, by providing crypto assets as collateral), malicious actors can match borrow and lend orders in such a way that the borrower pays much more APR than he has specified on a percentage of the principal he receives. This is a clear theft of funds, and in most cases the attacker can profit, if he matches the borrow order with a lend order of himself with a higher APR, and once the loan is repaid, collect the interest rate.

```solidity
  Alice's total borrowed:  499999000002
  The amount alice should have paid after 150 days on 5APR :  10273952054
  Alice's actual final interest payment:  10553568492
  Alice's overpays with:  279616438
  Alice's total paid amount:  510552568474
```

As can be seen from the logs above, and as explained in the example in the summary section, alice will overpay **~279e6 USDC**, this attack can be performed on multiple borrowers. **(( 10553568492 - 10273952054 ) /  10273952054) \* 100  = 2.72%**. The borrower overpays by more than **1%** and more than **$10**, which I believe satisfies the requirement for a high severity. 

To run the test use: ``forge test -vvv --mt test_InflateAPR``
