# The TaxTokensReceipt NFTs can't be utilized by a buy order

### Summary

The ``TaxTokenReceipt.sol`` contract allows users to deposit fee on transfer tokens to it, and it mints them an NFT, that NFT is supposed to be used across the Debita protocol, when users wants to use FOT tokens as collateral. In order to ensure that the NFT is utilized only within the Debita system, the [TaxTokensReceipt::transferFrom()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L93-L120) function is overridden to the following:
```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public virtual override(ERC721, IERC721) {
        bool isReceiverAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(to) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(to) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(to);
        bool isSenderAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(from) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(from) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(from);
        // Debita not involved --> revert
        require(
            isReceiverAddressDebita || isSenderAddressDebita,
            "TaxTokensReceipts: Debita not involved"
        );
        if (to == address(0)) {
            revert ERC721InvalidReceiver(address(0));
        }
        // Setting an "auth" arguments enables the `_isAuthorized` check which verifies that the token exists
        // (from != 0). Therefore, it is not needed to verify that the return value is not 0 here.
        address previousOwner = _update(to, tokenId, _msgSender());
        if (previousOwner != from) {
            revert ERC721IncorrectOwner(from, tokenId, previousOwner);
        }
    }
```
As can be seen from the above code snippet the ``to`` or ``from`` address has to be a borrow order, lend order or a loan. Clearly a  check whether the ``to`` or ``from`` addresses are a valid buyOrder is missing. When a user decides to fulfill the buyOrder by calling the [sellNFT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92-L141) function, the function will revert as the address of the buyOrder is not whitelisted in the  [TaxTokensReceipt::transferFrom()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L93-L120) function. This essentially means that the ``buyOrder.sol`` contract is not compatible with the TaxTokensReceipt NFTs.




### Root Cause

The overdriven [TaxTokensReceipt::transferFrom()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L93-L120) function, only checks whether the ``to`` or ``from`` addresses are a valid borrow order, lend order or a loan in order for a transfer to be successful. Since buyOrders are not listed, when a user who wishes to fulfill the buyOrder by calling the [sellNFT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92-L141) function, won't be able to as the function will always revert if the NFT that is being transferred is a TaxTokensReceipt NFT.
