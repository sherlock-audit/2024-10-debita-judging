# TaxTokenReceipt saves amount in tokenAmountPerID instead of received difference

### Summary

Let’s consider the function [`TaxTokensReceipts::deposit'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L59)
```solidity
function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
        return tokenID;
    }
```
We see that the tokenAmountPerID for tokenId is saved as amount - the number sent by the token user.

However, as stated in README - this contract supports FOT tokens. So in these cases amount can be more than the received value.

Further, when the funds are withdrawn, the user receives exactly amount and cannot withdraw less, although amount may not be kept on contract.
Thus, the user’s output is blocked. And in general the money flow of the whole protocol is disrupted.

```solidity
function withdraw(uint _tokenID) public nonReentrant {
        require(
            ownerOf(_tokenID) == msg.sender,
            "TaxTokensReceipts: not owner"
        );
        uint amount = tokenAmountPerID[_tokenID];
        tokenAmountPerID[_tokenID] = 0;
        _burn(_tokenID);

        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(ERC20(tokenAddress), msg.sender, amount);
        emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
### Root Cause

The user’s tokenAmountPerId is written as amount instead of difference.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

The user contributes funds to the contract. and then tries to take them away.
There may be a situation where he cannot pick up because the contract does not have enough funds to withdraw.

### Attack Path

### Impact
The mechanism is blocked and the FOT support is broken.
Severity: Medium
### PoC

### Mitigation

Save difference instead amount
