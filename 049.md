# Receipt NFTs will be permanently locked inside `buyOrder` when a user fills a buy order

### Summary

When a user chooses to sell their NFT through [sellNFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/376fec45be95bd4bbc929fd37b485076b03ab8b0/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92), the function transfers the wanted token into the contract. The problem is there is no way to retrieve this NFT from the contract and the user will be unable to fulfill their buy order leaving the NFT permanently locked in the contract.

### Root Cause

When the seller calls `sellNFT` with the receipt ID they wish to sell, it is transferred into the `buyOrder` contract.
```Solidity
IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            receiptID
        );
```
The problem is that currently there is no way for the creator of this buy order to receive their NFT. This is because there is no implementation within the contract that allows for the transfer to the buyer.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User creates a buy order through`buyOrderFactory`
2. A user fulfills this order which transfers the NFT into the `buyOrder` contract
3. NFT is locked permanently 

### Impact

Critical- complete loss of the receipt and loss of funds to the buyer

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement some logic to either transfer directly to the buyer, or transfer from the contract to the buyer.
