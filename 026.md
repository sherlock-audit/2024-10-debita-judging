# Insufficient check in getPrice() can return incorrect data

## Summary
``DebitaChainlink::getPrice`` is not checking ``answeredInRound`` value. The data returned can be incorrect due to an incomplete round.
## Vulnerability Details
``answeredInRound`` returns the round ID of the round in which the answer was computed. We should verify that ``answeredInRound >= roundId`` to ensure that the data we are seeing is fresh.
## Impact
Incorrect price returned by oracle can be very damaging to the protocol.

Manual Review
## Recommendation
Add the check require``(answeredInRound >= roundId)`` in ``getPrice``.
