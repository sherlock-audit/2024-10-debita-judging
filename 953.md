# Initialized variable in Ownerships contract is never set, rendering the onlyOwner modifier useless.

### Summary

The _Ownerships_ contract has an _initialized_ storage variable which is intended to track whether the contract has been initialized or not and is supposed to be set to true when the _setDebitaContract()_ function is called.

This _initialized_ variable is used for the _onlyOwner_ modifier which is used for the _setDebitaContract()_ and _transferOwnership()_ functions. 

As a result of _initialized_ never being assigned it defaults to false, which lets the owner transfer ownership and change the aggregator contract address even after it has been set once.

### Root Cause

The _initialized_ variable ([DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol:18](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol#L18)) is not being set to true when calling [_setDebitaContract()_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol#L40-L42).

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Once the _setDebitaContract()_ function is called, the owner shouldn't be able to set the aggregator contract again or change the owner but because of the missing assignment of the _initialized_ variable there is nothing that prevents him from doing so.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When calling _setDebitaContract()_ assign _initialized_ to true:
```diff
    function setDebitaContract(address newContract) public onlyOwner {
        DebitaContract = newContract;
+       initialized = true;
    }
```
