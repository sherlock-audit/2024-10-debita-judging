# use of fee-on-transfer token in DebitaIncentives.sol

### Summary

In the Q&A section in Readme.md the protocol states that [`Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in TaxTokensReceipt contract`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L20C3-L20C72). Meanwhile in the DebitaIncentives.sol there are no measures in place to check if the incentiveTokens have fee-on-transfer property. This could lead to users not been able to claim their incentives at some point. 

### Root Cause

The use of fee-on-transfer token (e.g DAI) as [`tokensIncentives`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L144C28-L144C44) could cause DOS when users claim incentives. As for every incentive paid by the contract to users, there is a percentage fee on the contract, this will lead to abnormal reduction in the contract incentive token balance. Which could eventually lead users not been to claim incentives at some point because the incentive token balance would not be enough for the users [`amountToClaim`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L200)

### Impact

DOS in users' incentives
Non-compliant of DebitaIncentives.sol regarding use of fee-on-transfer tokens only in `TaxTokensReceipt.sol`
