# NFT will be stuck in BuyOrder.sol contract

### Summary

After the buyer calls the `createBuyOrder` function, the `BuyOrder.sol` will be created, and the tokens will be transferred to the contract. When the seller of the NFT calls `sellNFT` in `BuyOrder`, the NFT will be transferred to the contract instead of the buyer, effectively locking the NFT permanently.

### Root Cause

In [sellNFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L99-L103) function, the NFT will be locked in the `BuyOrder.sol` contract:
```solidity
IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
-->         address(this),
            receiptID
        );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The buyer creates an order for 1000 USDT in exchange for an NFT. [createBuyOrder]

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

2. The seller receives the 1000 USDT and transfers the NFT, which will then be locked in the contract. [sellNFT]

### Impact

The buyer will pay for the NFT but will not receive it.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider transferring the NFT to the buyer instead of `address(this)` in the `sellNFT` function.
