# DebitaLoanOwnership.sol:: Wrong Implementaition of tokenURI()




### Summary

DebitaLoanOwnership is an ERC721 contract which mints NFT that represents the ownership of a user in the contract. User can be either a lender or a borrower.

tokenURI(id) is a function that return the mertaData if the ownershipNFT id..

```solidity
    address loanAddress = _debita.getAddressById(tokenId); 
```

But in tokenURI , instead of calling `_debita.getLoanIdByOwnershipID(tokenId)`  it is incorrectly calling the `_debita.getAddressById(tokenId)`;

`getAddressById(id)` considers the passed parameter as a loanId which is not an NFTId.

```solidity
string memory _type = tokenId % 2 == 0 ? "Borrower" : "Lender";
```
This is also an incorrect method to identify whether the owner of the tokenId is a borrower or lender. SInce , for a loan , multiple lendId can be minted after a borrowId is minted.

### Root Cause

incorrect call to getAddressById(tokenId)  instead of getLoanIdByOwnershipID(tokenId) in DebitaLoanOwnership contract.
