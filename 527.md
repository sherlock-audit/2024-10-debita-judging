# `DebitaChainLink` doesn't check for minAnswer/maxAnswer

### Summary

``DebitaChainLink`` Oracle doesn't validate for **minAnswer/maxAnswer**
ChainLink aggregators have a built-in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price spectrum. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value (i.e LUNA crash) the price of the Oracle will continue to return the **minPrice** instead of the actual price of the asset.
 since this project would be deployed on An ``EVM-Compatible network``  and they plan on interacting with 
> any ERC20 that follows exactly standard (e.g 18/6 decimals)

which indicates that the protocol is expected to use BNB, ETH, AAVE,AVAX; so the isssue related to chainlink ``BNB/USD, ETH/USD, AAVE/USD, AVAX/USD`` is also Applicable here.
Note that, according to the [docs](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/guidelines) of sherlock rules min/max check is considered a valid issue as long as :
> Issues related to minAnswer and maxAnswer checks on Chainlink's Price Feeds are considered medium only if the Watson explicitly mentions the price feeds (e.g. USDC/ETH) that require this check. 

``AAVE/USD`` and ``AVAX/USD`` are example of tokens that return minAnswer on Arbitrum, and they are countless examples


### Root Cause

Not checking the ``minAnswer`` for the specific token, and reverting if that is what the oracle returned

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The price of the asset drops below the minAnswer

### Attack Path

1. The price of the asset drops below the minAnswer
2. A user creates a borrow offer using the asset as collateral at it's inflated price

### Impact

This would allow users continue creating borrow offers with collaterals having wrong prices backing up their loans.

```solidity
    function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
   @>     (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```

### Mitigation

get the ``minPrice`` and ``maxPrice`` from the aggregator, then compare it to the price; revert if it goes outside the spectrum
```solidity
require( price >= minPrice && price <= maxPrice, "invalid price");
```
