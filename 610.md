# Bad actors will steal control of users' borrow positions by deleting them

### Summary

A missing ownership check in the borrow order factory will let malicious users delete anyone's borrow positions, putting users' funds at risk. Any user who has created even a tiny borrow order can delete other users' much larger positions, potentially causing them to lose access to their collateral.the same issue is in the `DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol`

### Root Cause

In `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol:171`, the contract trusts any borrow order to delete other orders - it's like giving everyone with a library card the power to burn anyone else's books:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L162-L177
```solidity

    modifier onlyBorrowOrder() {
        require(isBorrowOrderLegit[msg.sender], "Only borrow order");
        _;
    } 
```
so any legit user can delete the other users
```solidity
function deleteBorrowOrder(address _borrowOrder) external onlyBorrowOrder {
    uint index = borrowOrderIndex[_borrowOrder];
    borrowOrderIndex[_borrowOrder] = 0;
    ...
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Attacker needs to create any small borrow order to get their "deletion powers" (`isBorrowOrderLegit[attackerOrder] = true`)
2. A victim needs to have a juicy borrow position with at least 50k worth of tokens as collateral
3. The protocol needs to have at least 2 active orders (pretty much always true)

### External pre-conditions

1. Target token price needs to be high enough to make the attack worth the gas (e.g., token worth at least $50)
2. Network shouldn't be too congested (gas < 100 gwei) so the attack stays profitable


### Attack Path

### Initial Setup
1. Attacker initializes position:
   - Creates minimal borrow order (â‰ˆ1,000 token value)
   - Gains legitimate system access
   - Minimal capital requirement reduces attack cost

### Exploitation Process
2. Position Analysis:
   - Scans protocol for high-value positions
   - Targets positions with significant locked collateral (>100k token value)
   - Identifies vulnerable orders without proper access control

3. Attack Execution:
   - Attacker invokes `deleteBorrowOrder()` function
   - Uses their legitimate small position as access point
   - Targets identified high-value positions


### Impact

 Position Compromise:
   - Target position is deleted without authorization
   - Locked collateral becomes vulnerable
   - Position owner loses control of their assets

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
// @audit-fix Implement proper access control
function deleteBorrowOrder(address _borrowOrder) external {
    DBOImplementation order = DBOImplementation(_borrowOrder);
    require(order.owner() == msg.sender, "Hey! Not your order to delete!");
    // ... rest of deletion logic
}
```
