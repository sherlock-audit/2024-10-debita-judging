# anyone can changed the owner of  auctionFactoryDebita

### Summary

 in the contract **auctionFactoryDebita** the function **changeOwner**   is used to changed the owner of the contract  but the argument variable  shadows the contract owner variable which will make the owner to be anyone 
```solidity
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```
the problem here is that the require check doesn't properly check  instead of checking the msg.sender with the contract owner it is checking against the argument   **owner** this is caused due to variable shadowing 

### Root Cause

in auctionFactoryDebita line 218 the argument shadows an important variable
