# Sold NFT will remain stucked in BuyOrder Contract

### Summary

Sold NFT will remain stucked in BuyOrder since there is no method for owner to retrieve or approval for spending by another address

### Root Cause

NFT is sent to BuyOrder contract and it does not have any withdrawal method, also does not grant approval to any address to spend it.
```solidity
function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
        require(buyInformation.isActive, "Buy order is not active");
        require(
            buyInformation.availableAmount > 0,
            "Buy order is not available"
        );

        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this), //@note it enters this contract! and then how does it leave????
            receiptID
        );
```
