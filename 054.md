# Shadow Variable in `changeOwner()` will prevent owner update new ownership

### Summary


Shadowing variable `owner` in `AuctionFactory.sol`, and `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol` cause `changeOwner()` function to use local variable `owner` instead of storage variable `owner`.

This result in no new owner being updated to storage.
Also, anyone can bypass `changeOwner()` function owner permission check. Because owner is not changed so it is harmless for now.


### Root Cause


Here is shadowing variable code part
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218-L222>
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682-L686>

```solidity
contract auctionFactoryDebita {
  ...
    address owner; // owner of the contract

    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");//@audit H anyone can change Factory owner due to shadow variable.
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;//@owner never changed. this just updated local variable not storage variable
    }
  ...
}
```

`owner` variable above always point to local function variable. So storage variable `address owner` never used.

### Internal pre-conditions


- Admin create `AuctionFactory.sol` contract. Owner address is Admin address.
- Owner variable storage return Admin address

### External pre-conditions


- Any random user can call `changeOwner()` and bypass permission check
- Current Admin want to call `changeOwner()` to update new owner address

### Attack Path

- Admin after deployed try to change owner to DAO address will fail.
- Any user can call `changeOwner(address)` with their own address as input and call will always success.


### Impact

Not possible to change new admin after deployed. Resulting in redeployment.

Because anyone can bypass admin permission check, I consider this issue High despite any attempt to change admin always failed.

### PoC

Tested with `Auction.t.sol`

```solidity
    function testDebugChangeOwner() public {        
        address fakeOwner = address(0x1011);        
        vm.startPrank(fakeOwner);

        vm.expectRevert("Only the owner");// @not the owner
        factory.setFeeAddress(address(0));
        
        //try call change owner success
        factory.changeOwner(fakeOwner);
        // owner never change

        //fake owner try to call with admin still fail
        vm.expectRevert("Only the owner");// @not the owner
        factory.setFeeAddress(address(0));
        
        vm.stopPrank();

        // previous owner still work
        factory.setFeeAddress(address(0x0));
    }
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address _owner) public onlyOwner {
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = _owner;
    }
```
