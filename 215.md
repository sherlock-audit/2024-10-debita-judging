# Unsafe usage of ERC20 `transfer` and `transferFrom`.

### Summary

The `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

### Root Cause

According to readme it is stated that:
>We will interact with :

>any ERC20 that follows exactly the standard (eg. 18/6 decimals)
Receipt tokens (All the interfaces from "contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/..")
USDC and USDT
Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in TaxTokensReceipt contract

So the token can be usdt.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Some tokens (like USDT) don't correctly implement the EIP20 standard and their `transfer/ transferFrom` function return void instead of a success boolean. Calling these functions with the correct EIP20 function signatures will always revert.

### Impact

Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec, like USDT, will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.

### Mitigation

Use the OpenZepplin's `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` functions.
