# `extendLoan(...)` will revert sometimes leading to a DOS

### Summary

In order for a loan to be extended, [**at least 10% of the loan duration has to be transcurred in order to extend the loan**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L559). However, due to the evaluation of the unused `extendedTime` variable, the `extendLoan(...)` function can sometimes revert thus leading to a DOS preventing users from being able to extend their loans

The problem is caused by an overflow when calculating `extendedTime`


```solidity

File: DebitaV3Aggregator.sol
503:             offers[i] = DebitaV3Loan.infoOfOffers({
504:                 principle: lendInfo.principle,
505:                 lendOffer: lendOrders[i],
506:                 principleAmount: lendAmountPerOrder[i],
507:                 lenderID: lendID,
508:                 apr: lendInfo.apr,
509:                 ratio: ratio,
510:                 collateralUsed: userUsedCollateral,
511:    @>           maxDeadline: lendInfo.maxDuration + block.timestamp,


File: DebitaV3Loan.sol
138:     function initialize(
/////SNIP .....
164:    @>       startedAt: block.timestamp,


588:     @>          uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;

590:    @>           uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline -
591:                     alreadyUsedTime - 
592:                     block.timestamp;

```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- A loan with a `lendInfo.maxDuration` = 30days is matched (`startedAt`) on 1st Nov, @ 00:00hrs
- 21 days later ( 21st Nov), the borrower decides to extend
- the function reverts due to overflow as detailed in the _Root Cause_ section.

### Impact

This leads to DOS for users

### PoC

Given:
- `lendInfo.maxDuration` = 30days => 2592000
- `startedAt` = 1st Nov, @ 00:00hrs => 1730415600
- `block.timestamp` = 21st Nov, @ 00:00hrs => 1732143600
- `offer.maxDeadline` = ` lendInfo.maxDuration + startedAt` => 1733007600


On day 21, the borrower decides to extend the loan

```solidity
588:     @>          uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;
588:     @>          uint alreadyUsedTime = 1732143600- 1730415600 = 1728000

590:    @>           uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - alreadyUsedTime - block.timestamp;
590:    @>           uint extendedTime = 1733007600 - 1728000 - 1732143600
590:    @>           uint extendedTime = -864,000

```
`extendedTime` evaluates to a negative number leading to a revert despite fulfilling the condition that 10% of the duratio must have been transcured

### Mitigation

Modify the `extendLoan()` function by removing the `extendedTime` calculation since it is redundant as shown below

```diff

File: DebitaV3Loan.sol
547:     function extendLoan() public {
////SNIP    .............
587:             if (!offer.paid) {
588:                 uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;
589: 
-590:                 uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - 
-591:                     alreadyUsedTime - 
-592:                     block.timestamp;

```
