# Pyth Oracle Confidence Interval Not Considered in Price Calculations

### Summary

The `DebitaPyth::getThePrice` function fetches asset prices using the Pyth oracle but does not account for the confidence interval published alongside the price. [According to Pyth’s documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices), the confidence interval provides a measure of uncertainty, representing a range within which the true price lies with 95% probability (e.g., $50,000 ± $10). Ignoring this interval can lead to inaccurate or unsafe valuations, especially during periods of market volatility or disagreement among publishers. Proper use of the confidence interval is essential for the protocol to mitigate risks and ensure accurate valuations.

### Root Cause

The [`getThePrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaPyth.sol#L25) function retrieves only the price field from the Pyth feed (priceData.price) without considering the confidence field, which provides a measure of uncertainty or variance in the reported price.

### Attack Path

During a volatile market, a malicious actor can exploit the lack of consideration for the confidence interval by manipulating the protocol's valuations.

### Impact

1. For collateral-based operations, the protocol may overvalue or undervalue collateral due to the uncertainty in the price.
2. For loan operations, borrowers or lenders might gain an unfair advantage based on the protocol's inability to adjust for price uncertainty.
Both cases result in a potential loss if fund

### PoC

### Mitigation

Implement logic to detect when the confidence interval exceeds a certain percentage of the price `(confidence / price > threshold)`.
