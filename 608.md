# creating borrow orders with NFT collaterals may revert

### Summary

When `createBorrowOrder()` is called, the factory
- initialises the `borrowOffer` with the `_collateralAmount`
- transfers the NFT to the `borrowOffer` implementation contract and then goes on to check that the the balance of the `borrowOffer` is actually enough to cover the `_collateralAmount`

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L143-L144


The problem is that, if the `_collateral` is an NFT, the function may revert because a `IERC20` is being used to call an `IERC721` contract.
And as such, although the `IERC721` interface implements the `balanceOf()` function signature, but the return value is not guaranteed to be accurate and as such the check on L144 below may revert

```solidity
File: DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol
075:     function createBorrowOrder(
////SNIP    .........
142: 
143:   @>    uint balance = IERC20(_collateral).balanceOf(address(borrowOffer));
144:  @>     require(balance >= _collateralAmount, "Invalid balance");

```
