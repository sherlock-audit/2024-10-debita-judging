# Contract ownership might be lost forever due to the lack of a 2-step ownership transfer.

### Summary

[DebitaV3Aggregator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682), [auctionFactoryDebita](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218), [buyOrderFactory](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186) all 3 contracts have the same `changeOwner` function. This function directly resets contract owner to a new address. It does not have any address validation check. So if someone accidentally resets it to `address(0)` or to some other wrong address of which the private key was lost, there is no way to revert it.

### Root Cause

The `changeOwner` function of [DebitaV3Aggregator.changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682), [auctionFactoryDebita.changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218) and [buyOrderFactory..changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186) is as follows:

```solidity
// change owner of the contract only between 0 and 6 hours after deployment
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
}
```
It does not have any address validation check. It directly resets contract owner to a new address. 

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path

1. Call `changeOwner` function by passing `address(0)`.
2. Or call `changeOwner` function by passing an address of which the private key was lost. 

### Impact

1. If accidentally reset to `address(0)` or any incorrect address the contract ownership might be lost forever. 
2. The contract might be inoperable since all permissioned, owner only function will be inaccessible. 

### PoC
N/A

### Mitigation

1. Instead of direct assignment follow "propose then claim" approach. Introduce a `pendingOwner` state variable and a `claimOwnership` function that is only accessible by the new proposed owner.
2. Or use [OZ Ownable2Step](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v5.0.0/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol) contract.
