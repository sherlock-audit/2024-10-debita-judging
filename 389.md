# Reliance on a single oracle for WBTC pricing may result in bad debt

### Summary

As per the dev team wrappers versions of BTC and ETH can be used as collateral and principle. However, there is always possibility that WBTC depeg from BTC. In such a scenario, WBTC would no longer maintain an equivalent value to BTC/USD.

### Root Cause

WBTC may depeg from BTC. Consequently, WBTC's value would no longer be equivalent to BTC, potentially rendering it worthless.

```javascript
     [Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol]
      30     function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
      31         // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
      32         address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
      33         require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
      34         require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
      35         AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);
      36 
      37         // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
      38         // if it's down, revert
      39         if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
      40             checkSequencer();
      41         }
      42         (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
      43 
      44         require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
      45         require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
      46         return price;
      47     }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The WBTC bridge is compromised, or WBTC depegs from BTC due to technical or market issues.
2. The BTC/USD Chainlink oracle continues to report BTC prices without reflecting the depegged market value of WBTC.


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol suffers an accumulation of bad debt as loans affecting both the protocol and its users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a double oracle setup for WBTC pricing
