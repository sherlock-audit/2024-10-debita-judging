# Malicious users can exploit incentives by lending to themselves

### Summary

The lack of relationship checks between borrowers and lenders in the incentives system will allow users to game the incentives mechanism by lending to themselves, resulting in unfair rewards distribution as malicious users can artificially inflate their incentive rewards.

### Root Cause
function updateFunds：https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L306

The choice to not validate the relationship between borrowers and lenders in DebitaIncentives.sol is a mistake as it allows users to create artificial lending activity between accounts they control to farm incentives.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates a lending offer through DLOFactory.createLendOrder()：https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L124
2. Attacker creates a borrowing offer through DBOFactory.createBorrowOrder()：https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L75C14-L75C31
3. Attacker matches their own lending and borrowing offers through DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3()：https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274
4. The loan activity gets recorded and counts toward incentive calculations
5. At the end of each epoch, attacker receives incentive rewards  through DebitaIncentives.claimIncentives()：https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L142
6. Attacker can repeat this process to maximize incentive rewards

### Impact

The protocol suffers from unfair distribution of incentive rewards. Legitimate users receive diluted rewards as malicious users can artificially inflate their share of the rewards pool through self-lending transactions.
