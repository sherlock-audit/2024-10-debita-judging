# decimals() is Optional in ERC20 Tokens

### Summary

The `ERC20::decimals()` function is used in multiple places within the code. However, as per the ERC20 standard (EIP-20), decimals() is an optional method. This means that some tokens might not implement it, leading to failed calls and reverted transactions.

According to EIP-20:

>OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability, but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

### Root Cause

The reliance on decimals() in contracts assumes that all ERC20 tokens implement this function, which is not guaranteed. For example:

[TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L127](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L127)

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

The token interacting with the contract does not implement the decimals() function.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The contract becomes incompatible with ERC20 tokens that do not implement the decimals() function, causing calls to revert.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Create a wrapper function that safely attempts to call decimals() using try/catch. If the function is not implemented, provide a default value (e.g., 18, which is common for ERC20 tokens):
