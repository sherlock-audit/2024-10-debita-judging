# Incorrect calculation of `extendedTime`

### Summary

In the `DebitaV3Loan.sol` contract, the `extendLoan` function doesn't calculate `extendedTime` correctly because `block.timestamp` is subtracted twice. This can lead to negative or inaccurate `extendedTime`.

### Root Cause

When calculating [extendedTime](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L590-L592), the formula incorrectly subtracts `block.timestamp` twice: once as part of [alreadyUsedTime](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L588) (`block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt`), and then again in the calculation of `extendedTime`.

```solidity
                uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;

                uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline -
                    alreadyUsedTime -
                    block.timestamp;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Example Scenario:

`block.timestamp = 6`
`m_loan.startedAt = 0`
`offer.maxDeadline = 10`

`alreadyUsedTime` is calculated:
`alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;`
alreadyUsedTime = 6 - 0 = 6

`extendedTime` is calculated:
`extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - alreadyUsedTime - block.timestamp;`
extendedTime = 10 - 6 - 6 = -2

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The incorrect calculation causes the `extendLoan` function to revert whenever `extendedTime` becomes negative. It may also produce inaccurate values, resulting in improper fee calculations. This prevents users from successfully extending their loans, potentially leading to loan defaults or financial losses.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Calculate `extendedTime` correctly using the formula `extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - (m_loan.startedAt)`
