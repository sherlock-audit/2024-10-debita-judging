# `ChainlinkOracle` doesn't validate for minAnswer/maxAnswer

## Summary

`ChainlinkOracle` doesn't validate for minAnswer/maxAnswer

## Vulnerability Detail

Current implementation of `ChainlinkOracle` doesn't validate for the minAnswer/maxAnswer values .

Chainlink still has feeds that uses the min/maxAnswer to limit the range of values and hence in case of a price crash, These bounds are essential to filter out invalid prices during anomalies or system failures. Since the project plans to deploy in `Any EVM-compatbile network`, I am attaching the link to BNB/USD oracle which still uses min/maxAnswer and is one of the highest tvl tokens in BSC <https://bscscan.com/address/0x137924d7c36816e0dcaf016eb617cc2c92c05782#readContract>, similar check exists for ETH/USD

## Impact
If the system accepts out-of-range prices:
1. Collateral may be undervalued, leading to unnecessary liquidations.
2. Borrowers may exploit overvalued prices to obtain excessive loans.
3. Overall, this creates risks of systemic failure and loss of user funds, particularly on networks where such price anomalies are more common.
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
If the price is outside the minPrice/maxPrice of the oracle, activate a breaker to reduce further losses
