# Absence of getter for aggregatorContract in the Orderfactory causes issues

### Summary
From the README:
>We have chosen to route all loans through the aggregator to maintain a consistent creation path.

`DebitaV3Aggregator` contract is used to create loans by calling `matchOffersV3()` which can be called by anyone including bots and the users are encourage to call match orders by sending a fee percentage to the msg.sender.

But,since the `aggregatorContract` variable is kept as private in the `borrowOrderFactory` and `lendOrderFactory` and  due to the absence of a getter function for `aggregatorcontract`,it restricts users from calling the `matchOffersV3` to match  orders  and thus making the protocol less effective.

While these issues can be mitigated by enforcing  on the front end to validate the AggregatorContract address when it is deployed, relying solely on the front end introduces potential risks. For instance, users interacting with the contract directly (e.g., through scripts or other wallets) would remain vulnerable to these problems.

### Root Cause

aggregator contract address is kept as private and lack of a getter function for it.


### Internal pre-conditions
_No response_


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

By restricting access to the AggregatorContract address, users cannot directly call matchOffersV3 to match orders. This reduces the protocol's ability to facilitate matches effectively.



### PoC
_No response_

### Mitigation

it is recommended to provide a getter function in the contract to expose the aggregator address to public, ensuring transparency and usability for all users.
