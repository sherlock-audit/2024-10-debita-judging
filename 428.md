# Attacker will delete all active lend orders, causing a Denial of Service for all users

### Summary

In the smart contract `DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol`, the [cancelOffer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L144) and [addFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162) functions do not check if the lend offer is active (isActive). It only validates if `availableAmount > 0`.

This allows a malicious lend offer owner to repeatedly exploit the protocol. He can call `cancelOffer()` to remove his offer from the factory’s active orders list, then use `addFunds()` to add a small amount back to the canceled offer, making it appear valid again. They can then cancel the offer again to delete another offer in the factory list.
By repeating this process, the attacker can systematically delete all lending offers in the lend offer factory.

As a result, the attacker causes a Denial of Service (DoS) for other users, leaving the protocol with no active lend orders.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol`, the [cancelOffer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L144) and [addFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162) do not check if the offer isActive

### Attack Path

1.	**Preparation:**
	•	The attacker calls `createLendOrder()` in `DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol` to create a lend offer and ensures it has a valid availableAmount. We’ll call it **_AttackerOrder_**
	•	The _AttackerOrder_ is added to the factory’s active orders list.
2.	 **Removing the order:**
	•	The attacker calls `cancelOffer()` on _AttackerOrder_.
	•	This marks _AttackerOrder_ as inactive and removes it from the factory’s active orders list by calling the deleteOrder() function (LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder] = 0).
3.	**Reactivating the order:**
	•	The attacker calls `addFunds(1 wei)` on _AttackerOrder_.
	•	This function does not validate if the lend offer is active (isActive).
	•	Adding a small amount of funds makes _AttackerOrder_ `appear valid` again. (`availableAmount += amount;`)
4.	**First exploit: Removing Another order:**
	•	The attacker calls cancelOffer() again on _AttackerOrder_.
	•      The function does not check that the lend offer is not active (isActive). It only checks if availableAmount > 0.      
	•	It calls deleteOrder() from factory to remove the _AttackerOrder_.: 
                 `IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this))`
	•	[`deleteOrder()` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L205-L220) changes the index of the last order to the index of _AttackerOrder_. Since the index of _AttackerOrder_ was set to zero in step two, the index of the last order also becomes zero, meaning it gets deleted from the list as well.
	•	The vulnerability allows this operation to remove another unrelated order from the factory’s active orders list.
5.	**Repeat:**
	•	The attacker repeats steps 3 and 4.
	•	With each iteration, another order is removed from the factory’s active orders list.
6.	**Final Outcome:**
	•	The attacker continues this process until all active lend orders in the factory are deleted.

### Impact

The protocol is left with no active lend orders, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) for all legitimate users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add this check to `cancelOffer()` and `addFunds()` functions in `DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol`:
`require(isActive, "Offer is not active");`
