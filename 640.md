# Lack of change feeAddress functional in `buyOrderFactory`

### Summary

To start with, consider the contract 'AuctionFactory'. Its structure is similar to `BuyOrderFactory`.
```solidity
constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        feeAddress = msg.sender;
        deployedTime = block.timestamp;
    }
```
We see that feeAddress = owner when the fault. However, the functionality of 'AuctionFactory' allows to change both owner and [feeAddress](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L214).
```solidity
function setFeeAddress(address _feeAddress) public onlyOwner {
        feeAddress = _feeAddress;
    }

    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```
Same owner = feeAddress when deploying in the BuyOrderFactory contract
However, buyOrderFactory does not implement the feeAddress change feature.

feeAddress is the address where the txes from sale comes. So if it becomes outdated, protocol will lose the txes.

Considering that such a function is implemented in an identical contract, but not implemented in this - it is not design decision of protocol.

### Root Cause

Lack of change feeAddress functionality

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Stale feeAddress become compromised and protocol start loosing txes

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Considering that this is not a design decision protocol, but an error in the code development, I think that impact High, likelihood:low, Severity: Medium

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add change feeAddress functionality
