# TaxTokenReceipt NFT will get stuck in the Auction contract.




### Summary

`TaxTokenReceipt` Contract is an `ERC721` contract with an override `tranferFrom(from,to,tokenId)` function.
Right now , `NFTs` minted by the contract can only be sent if, either the `from` address or the `to` address is a `Debita` Contract.
 whitelisted addresses are  `borrowOrder` , `lendOrder` or `loan` adress

But when the `NFT`  goes for the `auction` the `auction` contract cannot transfer the `NFT` to the auction `buyer` since either the `sender` nor the `receiver` is whitelisted in the `TaxTokenReceipt` contract.

### Root Cause

`transferFrom` function can only transfer `NFTs` if , `sender` or `receiver` is either a legit `borrowOrder`/`lendOrdere` or a legit `loan`.
[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L93-L105)
```solidity
function transferFrom(address from,address to,uint256 tokenId) public virtual override(ERC721, IERC721) {
        bool isReceiverAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(to) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(to) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(to);
        bool isSenderAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(from) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(from) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(from);
            require(
            isReceiverAddressDebita || isSenderAddressDebita,
            "TaxTokensReceipts: Debita not involved"
        );
        .....
```

But the protocol didnt consider the case when the `NFT` goes for the auction.
Even though the auction validity of an `auction` can be validated from `auctionFactory`, protocol missed to whitelist the auction contracts. 

### Internal pre-conditions
TaxTokenReceipt as a collateral undergoes auction.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The TaxTokenReceipt collateral will get stuck in the auction contract. Lenders will suffer from loss of 100% funds.

### PoC

1) A loan is created where the collatteral is a TaxTokenReceipt NFT and there are multiple lenders.
2) Borrower fails to pay the debt.
3) Lender calls createAuction() for liwuidating the collatteral.
4) NFT is transferred to the auction contract.
5) Now even if the buyer want to buy the NFT on auction, the function will revert with "TaxTokensReceipts: Debita not involved" message.
6) The NFT got stuck in the auction Contract.

### Mitigation

Whitelist the auction contract by adding,
IAuctionFactory(auctionFactory).isAuction(to)
