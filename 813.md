# Borrower cannot extend his loan due to the incorrect comparison with feePerDay instead of minFee




### Summary

Due to incorrect comparison with `feePerDay` instead of `minFee`, the `extendLoan()` will  get revert  in some situtaions. Hence the `borrowers` can go through undesired liuquidation.


### Root Cause

`PorcentageOfFeePaid` contains the total fee perecentage which is calcualted to get the total fees for the initial duration of the loan.[code])https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L571-L572).

the min value `PorcentageOfFeePaid` can have is `minFee` due to the below check.[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L575-L579)
```solidity
        if (PorcentageOfFeePaid > maxFee) {
            PorcentageOfFeePaid = maxFee;
        } else if (PorcentageOfFeePaid < minFEE) {
            PorcentageOfFeePaid = minFEE;
        }
```

Now when the borrower decides to extend the loan to a new duration new fees needs to be caluclated for the extented time.

For this, protocol find the total fees for the enitre duration including the extended time and subtract intitial Duraition fees from it.

    ```solidity
            if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
                // calculate difference from fee paid for the initialDuration vs the extra fee they should pay because of the extras days of extending the loan.  MAXFEE shouldnt be higher than extra fee + PorcentageOfFeePaid
                uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /
                    86400);
                if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
                    feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
    =>           } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) {
                    feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
                }


    =>            misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
            }
    ```
But here , the min value of `feeOfMaxDeadline` is compared with the feePerDay instead of minFee.
Range of values both can have is 
    1<=feePerDay <= 10 [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L658-L662)
    10<=minFee <=50 [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L670-L674)

now if the `feeOfMaxDeadline` which holds the fees for the entire newDuration is less than `minFee` it will revert in the line :

` misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;`

because , PercentageOfFeePaid will always be greater than or equal to `minFee`.

### Attack Path
Assume,
    `feePerDay` = `0.5% ` => `5` basispoint
    `minFee` = `5%` =>`50` basispoint

Loan has been created with `intialDuration` = `8 days`.

borrower has called `extendLoan()`  to extend for `1` more day , `newDuration` = `9 days`,

Now , 
 `PorcentageOfFeePaid` is caclualted as 
  `PorcentageOfFeePaid = numberofDays * feePerDay =  8 * 0.5 = 4%;`
Since it is less than `minFee` ,

  ` PorcentageOfFeePaid = 5%`

Now calcuation for `feeOfMaxDeadline` is

    ` feeOfMaxDeadline = numberofDays * feePerDay =  9 * 0.5 = 4.5%; `

Since `feeOfMaxDeadline`'s minValue is considered as `0.5` and  `4.5` > `0.5` ,

    ` feeOfMaxDeadline = 4.5% ` No change,


 Now `missingBorrowFee` is calculated, `misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;`

    `misingBorrowFee = 4.5% - 5%;`  

 **resulting to revert.**


### Impact

Borrower cannot extend his loan due to the incorrect comparison with feePerDay instead of minFee causing undesired liquidation.

### Mitigation


```solidity
        if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
            // calculate difference from fee paid for the initialDuration vs the extra fee they should pay because of the extras days of extending the loan.  MAXFEE shouldnt be higher than extra fee + PorcentageOfFeePaid
            uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /
                86400);
            if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
                feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
=>           } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < minFee) {
                feeOfMaxDeadline = minFee;
            }


            misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
        }
```
