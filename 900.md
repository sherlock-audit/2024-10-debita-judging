# Funds will be stuck in the contract and can never be withdrawn

### Summary

The project does not account for the scenario where no borrow or lend actions occur, resulting in the incentive funds being permanently stuck in the contract. This is because the incentive funds can only be withdrawn through `claimIncentives`, but in the absence of borrow and lend actions

### Root Cause

The project does not handle the scenario where no borrow or lend actions occur, resulting in the incentive funds being stuck.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. During a certain epoch, no users call `matchOffersV3`.  
2. During the same epoch, a user or administrator calls `incentivizePair`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An administrator or a user calls `incentivizePair` to encourage more borrowing or lending by other users.  
2. However, there are still not enough orders during that epoch to call `matchOffersV3`.

### Impact

The funds will be permanently stuck in the contract and cannot be withdrawn

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Record the number of matched orders for each epoch. If the number of matched orders is zero, allow a new function to withdraw the incentive funds.
