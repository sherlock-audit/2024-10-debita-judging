# Auction Manipulation Risk: Liquidated Borrowers Potentially Reclaiming Collateral and Evading Debt Repayment

### Summary

The missing check of preventing liquidated borrowers from participating in their own liquidation auction in ['auction.buyNFT()'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L109-L184) can lead to them buying back their own collateral at a discounted price. This allows the borrower to evade full debt repayment, regain control of their asset without fully satisfying their debt obligations, or at a price lower than the original debt.

### Root Cause

In `auction.sol:109-184` there's no check on ensuring a liquidated borrower does not participate in their own liquidation auction.
The protocol ensures that in a liquidation auction, the funds from the sale are used to settle the borrower's debt, and the collateral (NFT) is transferred to the buyer.
```solidity
        // If it's a liquidation, handle it properly
        if (m_currentAuction.isLiquidation) {
            debitaLoan(s_ownerOfAuction).handleAuctionSell(
                currentPrice - feeAmount
            );
        }
        IERC721 Token = IERC721(s_CurrentAuction.nftAddress);
        Token.safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            msg.sender,
            s_CurrentAuction.nftCollateralID
        );
```
However it does not include a check to prevent a liquidated borrower from participating in their own liquidation auction.

### Attack Path

1. Borrower takes a loan of 100 USDC against an NFT valued at 150 USDC at the time of the loan.
2. The value of the NFT drops due to market conditions, falling to 120 USDC, triggering a liquidation.
3. The protocol sets up an auction where the starting price is 110 USDC (loan + liquidation fees).
4. The borrower sees the NFT collateral being auctioned at 110 USDC.
5. The borrower knows the NFT's value will likely rise when the market recovers and wants to repurchase it.
6. The borrower bids 110 USDC (the minimum price) reacquiring the NFT.
7. The borrower regains the NFT for 110 USDC, which is below the current market value of 120 USDC or the potential future value (let’s say it’s worth 150 USDC after market recovery).
8. The protocol only recovers 110 USDC, which is less than the full loan value, meaning it doesn’t cover the full 100 USDC loan + liquidation fees.
9. The protocol loses at least 20 USDC (the difference between the auction price and a higher potential recovery value)

### Impact

If this practice is widespread and borrowers can continue to manipulate the system, the protocol could face insolvency issues

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Liquidated borrowers should be restricted from participating in the auction to prevent them from reclaiming their collateral at a discounted price.
