# The `AuctionFactory.changeOwner` function reverts because it uses incorrect variable name

### Summary

The `changeOwner` function of the `AuctionFactory` contract uses the same input variable name as the `owner` variable.
As a result, changing owner is impossible.

### Root Cause

The input variable name of `changeOwner` function is same as owner storage variable.

```solidity
@37:    address owner; // owner of the contract
        [...]
@218:   function changeOwner(address owner) public {
            require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
            require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
            owner = owner;
        }
```

In the function, `owner` is treated as a local variable. Therefore, if the contract owner tries to change the owner, `msg.sender` will always differ from `owner`.

### Internal pre-conditions

Alice is owner of the `AuctionFactory` contract

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

1. Alice is going to change the owner to Bob.
2. Because `msg.sender = Alice` and `owner = Bob`, it reverts by the `require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner")`.

### Impact

The `changeOwner` function reverts

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

In the `changeOwner` function, change the input variable name different from `owner`.
