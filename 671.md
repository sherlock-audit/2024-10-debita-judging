# Improper use of `limit` will cause out-of-bounds access and invalid data return in function `getActiveBuyOrders`

## **Summary**  
The function `getActiveBuyOrders` incorrectly uses the `limit` variable instead of the adjusted `length`, which is meant to account for the `activeOrdersCount`. This discrepancy can lead to out-of-bounds array access and invalid data in the returned results, potentially disrupting the system and impacting the reliability of data for users or integrators.

## **Root Cause**  
The variable `limit` is adjusted to `length` when it exceeds `activeOrdersCount` to ensure safe and correct operation. However, subsequent operations continue to reference `limit`, ignoring the adjustment. Specifically:
- The loop range (`offset + limit`) and array initialization (`limit - offset`) do not respect the adjusted `length`, leading to runtime errors when `limit` exceeds `activeOrdersCount`.

## **Impact**  
1. **Out-of-Bounds Array Access:**  
   - When `limit > activeOrdersCount`, the function attempts to access indices outside the bounds of the `allActiveBuyOrders` array, causing the function to revert or crash.

2. **Invalid Data Return:**  
   - The `_activeBuyOrders` array may include uninitialized elements if the loop runs beyond valid indices, returning incomplete or erroneous results to the caller.

3. **User Disruption:**  
   - Users or integrators relying on accurate and paginated data may encounter errors, degrading the functionality and reliability of the system.

## **Mitigation**  

1. **Replace `limit` with `length` Post-Adjustment:**  
   Update all references to `limit` in the array initialization and loop range to use the adjusted `length` variable:
   ```solidity
   uint length = limit;

   if (limit > activeOrdersCount) {
       length = activeOrdersCount;
   }

   BuyOrder.BuyInfo[] memory _activeBuyOrders = new BuyOrder.BuyInfo[](
       length - offset
   );
   for (uint i = offset; i < length; i++) { 
       address order = allActiveBuyOrders[i];
       _activeBuyOrders[i - offset] = BuyOrder(order).getBuyInfo();
   }
   ```
