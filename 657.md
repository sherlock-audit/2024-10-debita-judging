# Lack of any validation in emitDelete function

### Internal pre-conditions

The attacker needs to make at least 1 loan.
- The attacker's address must be in mapping `isBorrowOrderLegit `

The value true is assigned in function `createBorrowOrder`

```solidity
function createBorrowOrder(){
  ...
  isBorrowOrderLegit[address(borrowOffer)] = true;
  ...
}
```
