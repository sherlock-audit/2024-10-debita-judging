# Paying debt will revert at the last second of `maxDeadLine`.

### Summary

A bug in the `DebitaV3Loan.payDebt()` function causes debt repayment to revert if attempted exactly at the `maxDeadline`, resulting in unintended liquidation of the borrower’s collateral. This happens due to inconsistent use of strict (`>`) and non-strict (`>=`) inequality checks in the code.


### Root Cause

The issue lies in the way the contract checks the maxDeadline.
In the [DebitaV3Loan.payDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L186-L257) function, the `offer.maxDeadline` is checked with strict inequality (`>`):
```solidity
    require(offer.maxDeadline > block.timestamp, "Deadline passed");
    }
```
However, elsewhere in the same function, such as in `nextDeadline()` validation, the code uses non-strict inequality (`>=`):
```solidity
    require(nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp, "Deadline passed to pay Debt");
```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A borrower takes out a loan with a specific `maxDeadline`.
2. When the `block.timestamp` reaches the exact `maxDeadline`, the borrower attempts to call `payDebt()` to repay the loan.
3. The transaction fails due to the strict `>` condition, and the borrower’s collateral is subsequently liquidated.


### Impact

This bug can cause unintended collateral liquidation, leading to:
- Financial losses for borrowers, even when they are compliant with the loan terms.
- A breakdown of trust in the platform’s fairness and reliability.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the `>` with the `>=` in the `payDebt()` function.
```diff
        ... SKIP ...
-       require(offer.maxDeadline > block.timestamp, "Deadline passed");
+       require(offer.maxDeadline >= block.timestamp, "Deadline passed");
        ... SKIP ...
```
