# DebitaV3Aggregator::changeOwner function does not change owner

### Summary

This protocol is ownable and a lot of core functionalities are onlyOwner. `DebitaV3Aggregator::changeOwner` function does not change the owner instead it overrides the value of local parameter and storage remains unchanged.

### Root Cause

[Source](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682C1-L686C6)
In `DebitaV3Aggregator::changeOwner` the `owner` parameter name shadows the name of `owner` storage variable. Because of this issue within the function execution `owner` is the local variable and not the storage variable. In below code, the `require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner")` condition will always be satisfied.

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
@>      require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
@>      owner = owner;
    }
```

        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
--      owner = owner;
++      owner = _owner;
    }
```
