# ChainlinkOracle does not check if the returned answer is outside the min/max range for token

### Summary

Chainlink aggregators include a circuit breaker mechanism that activates if an asset's price moves beyond a predefined range. In the event of a massive price collapse (e.g. the LUNA crash), the oracle price remains fixed at the minPrice rather than reflecting the asset's true market value.

If this were to happen, malicious borrowers using the token whose price collapsed as collateral could borrow more than their collateral is worth, stealing from lenders.

Example of ERC20 compliant tokens with this functionality on Arbitrum:
- aave/usd: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3c6AbdA21358c15601A3175D8dd66D0c572cc904#readContract#F19
- avax/usd: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf17b68a40f10d3DcEedd9a092F1Df331cE3D9da#readContract#F19

### Root Cause

Not checking the minAnswer for the specific token, and reverting if that is what the oracle returned.

### Internal pre-conditions

n/a

### External pre-conditions

Collateral token price drops below `minAnswer`

### Attack Path

1. Collateral token price falls below minAnswer
2. Malicious borrower reads existing loan offer(s) and then creates a borrow offer that will successfully match loan offers at the `minAnswer` price returned via the Chainlink oracle where the value of the borrow amount is greater than the value of the collateral.
3. Malicious borrower uses the aggregator to match their borrower offer to the loan offer(s)
4. Since the value of the borrow amount is greater than the collateral value, the malicious borrower makes off with a profit with no incentive the repay the loan.

### Impact

Users will borrow an amount worth more than the collateral causing losses to lenders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Get the minPrice and maxPrice from the aggregator and compare it to the price. Revert if it's outside the bounds:
```solidity
    require(answer >= minPrice && answer <= maxPrice, "invalid price");
```
