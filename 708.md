# An attacker can steal the entire borrow and lending incentive of an epoch with FLASHLOAN in a single transaction

### Summary

An attacker, with the aid of flash-loan can steal the entire borrow and lending incentives.

This involves the attacker creating a huge lend offer with funds from flash-loan, creating a borrow offer with dust amount as collateral, self-matching the offer, paying back the loan in the same block(with zero interest) and having extra principle to payback flash-loan fees, then claim the entire incentive after the epoch has ended.

### Root Cause

1. Same address can be the borrower, lender and connector, there is no check against this.
2. ```DebitaV3Loan.payDebt()``` allows repayment of loan in the same block it was taken. (Allows the use of flash-loan to access huge funds!)
3. Lender can set ratio high enough to allow borrower take huge loan with dust collateral(1wei).(this reduced flash-loan needed as 1wei can be used as collateral to get unlimited principle amount reduce fees(flash-loan) and make attack more feasible/profitable).

### Internal pre-conditions

Incentive is huge enough to cover attack expenses(flash-loan fees, loan disbursement fee and off-cus gasFee!)

### External pre-conditions

1. Attacker has extra principle to cover flash-loan fees(0.05% in Aave V3)
2. Attack capital becomes lower when the borrow/lend inn the current epoch is low

### Attack Path

1. Attacker takes in account the amount of incentives and total borrow/lent of the current epoch to determine profitability and also to know if there is capital(flash-loan fee).
2. Attacker takes flash-loan, in the flash loan call-back, 
3. A block to the end of an epoch, creates a lend offer with HUGE ratio!(100e24 for instance) allowing borrowing huge amount with 1wei, no check/limit for this
4. creates a borrow offer using 1wei as collateral
5. calls ```matchOfferV3()```, matching the offers, min fee of 0.2% is deducted in which 15% of it goes back to attacker, so only 0.17% net paid as fees
6. pays back by calling ```payDebt()```, offcus no fee on interest since Apr is set to zero
7. pays back flash-loan and fees
8. epoch ends, and attacker claims almost all incentives(borrow + lend) in the next block(after the end of the epoch), since lent and borrow will be almost 100%, thanks to FLASH-LOAN!

### Impact

Attacker steals larger share of incentives

### PoC

Repayment is possible in the same block! the only tiime check is for deadline
```solidity
        // check next deadline
        require(
            nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp,
            "Deadline passed to pay Debt"
        );
```

```solidity
  } else {
                maxRatio = lendInfo.maxRatio[collateralIndex]; //@audit attacker set this to be large to allow the use of dust collateral
            }
            // calculate ratio based on porcentage of the lend order
            uint ratio = (maxRatio * porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder[i]) / 10000;
            uint m_amountCollateralPerPrinciple = amountCollateralPerPrinciple[
                principleIndex
            ];
            // calculate the amount of collateral used by the lender
            uint userUsedCollateral = (lendAmountPerOrder[i] *
                (10 ** decimalsCollateral)) / ratio; //@audit collateral required for large loan becomes dust!
```

```solidity
   // check ratio for each principle and check if the ratios are within the limits of the borrower
        for (uint i = 0; i < principles.length; i++) {
            require(
                weightedAverageRatio[i] >= //@audit attacker set both, so this aligns!
                    ((ratiosForBorrower[i] * 9800) / 10000) &&
                    weightedAverageRatio[i] <=
                    (ratiosForBorrower[i] * 10200) / 10000,
                "Invalid ratio"
            );
```

```solidity
// check if the apr is within the limits of the borrower
            require(weightedAverageAPR[i] <= borrowInfo.maxApr, "Invalid APR"); //@audit Apr is set to zero, so no fee on interest!
```

### Mitigation

1. Prevent repayment in the same block
2. It might be helpful to prevent lender == borrower == connector
