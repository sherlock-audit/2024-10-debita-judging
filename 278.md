# [M-4] `TaxTokensReceipt::deposit` would fail in case a fee-on-transfer ERC-20 token is used.

### Summary

The `TaxTokensReceipt::deposit` function fails to support fee-on-transfer ERC-20 tokens due to a strict balance check that does not account for the transfer fee deducted by the token. This is contrary to the contest documentation, which specifies that fee-on-transfer tokens are intended to be used with this contract.


### Root Cause

The issue arises from the highlighted line in the [`TaxTokensReceipt::deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L59-L75) function:

```js
    function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
@>        require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
        return tokenID;
    }
```
This check ensures that the contract's balance increases by the full amount specified by the user during the transfer. However, fee-on-transfer tokens deduct a portion of the transferred amount as a fee, meaning the balance increase will always be less than the specified amount. As a result, the require statement would fail, causing the transaction to revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `deposit` function is called by a user with an amount of ERC-20 fee-on-transfer tokens to deposit.

### External pre-conditions

The fee-on-transfer ERC-20 tokens involved in the transaction applies a fee-on-transfer mechanism, reducing the amount of tokens actually transferred to the contract. The protocol intends to support fee-on-transfer tokens, as mentioned in the contest [documentation](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/627?filter=questions) "Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in TaxTokensReceipt contract".

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol cannot process deposits for fee-on-transfer tokens as intended. Any attempt to deposit such tokens will fail, as the balance check in the `TaxTokensReceipt::deposit` function will always revert. This restricts the protocol's functionality and makes it incompatible with the intended use case outlined in the [contest documentaion](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/627?filter=questions).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The protocol can address this issue through one of the following approaches:
1. Explicitly exclude fee-on-transfer tokens in `TaxTokensReceipt.sol` OR
2. Adjust the logic in the `TaxTokensReceipt::deposit` function to account for the transfer fee by removing the strict balance increase check.
