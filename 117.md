# Lenders or borrowers may lose their expected bribe rewards

### Summary

In [updateFunds:316](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L316), we will return directly if we meet one un-whitelist pair. This will block subsequent lend order to update and earn rewards.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaIncentives:306](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L306), the aggregator will update funds to each lend order and the borrow order 's lend/borrow principle amount. This record will be used to claim bribe rewards.
The problem is that in this lend order's loop, when we meet one un-whitelist pair(principle/collateral), we will return directly. This will cause the subsequent lender order cannot update the record and will lose the bribe rewards.
```solidity
    function updateFunds(
        infoOfOffers[] memory informationOffers,
        address collateral,
        address[] memory lenders,
        address borrower
    ) public onlyAggregator {
        for (uint i = 0; i < lenders.length; i++) {
            // Here we check whether this principle/collateral pair is in the whitelist.
            // If this is not in the whitelist, we will not earn any bribe rewards.
            bool validPair = isPairWhitelisted[informationOffers[i].principle][
                collateral
            ];
            // @audit is this correct, maybe we should use break here.
            if (!validPair) {
                return;
            }
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. The admin set one pair USDT(principle)/WETH(collateral) into the whitelist, and USDC(principle)/WETH(collateral) is not in the whitelist.
2. Alice creates one borrow order. Collateral is WETH, accepted principle is USDT/USDC.
3. Bob creates one lend order. Principle is USDT, and accepted collateral is WETH.
4. Cathy creates one lend order.Principle is USDC, and accepted collateral is WETH.
5. Dean matches these three order and put Cathy's lend order as the first lend order, and Bob's lend order as the second one.
6. In updateFunds(), bob's lend order's principle amount cannot be recorded even if the pair (USDT/WETH) is in the whitelist.

### Impact

Lenders and borrowers may lose some bribe rewards.

### Mitigation

We need to loop all lend orders, any lend order with the whitelist pair should be recorded and claim some bribe rewards.
```diff
             if (!validPair) {
-                return;
+                continue;
             }
```
