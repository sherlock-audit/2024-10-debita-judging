# Silent Return in updateFunds() Causes Partial State Updates Leading to Incentive Accounting Inconsistencies

### Summary
The `DebitaIncentives::updateFunds` function in DebitaIncentives.sol silently returns when encountering an invalid pair, causing partial state updates and breaking incentive accounting. This leads to some lenders' funds not being properly tracked in the incentive system.

### Root Cause
The function uses a simple `return` statement instead of reverting when an invalid pair is detected, causing the function to exit prematurely after processing only some of the lenders, leaving the remaining valid lenders unprocessed.

### Internal pre-conditions
- Function called by Aggregator contract
- Multiple lenders in the input array
- At least one valid pair before an invalid pair

### External pre-conditions
- Aggregator must have proper permissions
- Valid lender addresses provided
- Valid offer information available

### Attack Path
1. Aggregator calls updateFunds with multiple lenders
2. First lender has valid pair - processed successfully
3. Second lender has invalid pair - function returns silently
4. Third and subsequent lenders (even with valid pairs) - never processed
5. State updates remain incomplete

### Impact
- Inconsistent incentive accounting
- Loss of rewards for valid lenders
- Incorrect total lending amounts
- Skewed reward distributions
- Platform's incentive mechanism compromised



### Mitigation
```diff
function updateFunds(
    infoOfOffers[] memory informationOffers,
    address collateral,
    address[] memory lenders,
    address borrower
) public onlyAggregator {
    for (uint i = 0; i < lenders.length; i++) {
        bool validPair = isPairWhitelisted[informationOffers[i].principle][collateral];
-       if (!validPair) {
-           return;
-       }
+       require(validPair, "Invalid pair");
        
        // ... rest of the function ...
    }
}
```

The fix replaces the silent return with a require statement to:
1. Prevent partial updates
2. Ensure all valid pairs are processed
3. Maintain consistent incentive accounting
4. Make failures visible and traceable
