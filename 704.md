# Attacker will de-list entries to borrowOrders factory

### Summary

The borrow Factory contract doesn't follow the CEI pattern for the function `createBorrowOrder`, because of which an attacker can de-list the borrow order of the first (zero) index in the borrowFactory contract.

This can be repeated to delete every legitimate borrow implementation contract registered in the borrowFactory by a motivated attacker on the `allActiveBorrowOrders` mapping.

### Root Cause

In [borrowFactory](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L124) the borrow order contract is created and made legit by setting `isBorrowOrderLegit` to true for the created borrow order

However, there is a call to the collateral contract immediately afterwards. The entries to the appropriate structures like `borrowOrderIndex`, `allActiveBorrowOrders` hasn't been made yet.


The collateral address passed can be a malicious contract, this contract can have content like

```solidity
contract XYZ
{
    function attack( address factory, ... )
    {
    DBOFactory(factory).createBorrowOrder( ... )
    // This call is to make sure the borrow.owner is this contract
    }


    function transferFrom(address collateral, address sender, address borrowAddress, uint256 amount) returns(bool)
    {
        DBOImplementation(borrowAddress).cancelOffer();
        return true;
    }


}
```

In `deleteBorrowOrder` in borrow factory contract, the index of the borrow order is taken, however since in this attack the borrowIndex hasn't been set yet, it'll default to zero.

```solidity
function deleteBorrowOrder(address _borrowOrder) external onlyBorrowOrder {
        // get index of the borrow order
@>        uint index = borrowOrderIndex[_borrowOrder];
        borrowOrderIndex[_borrowOrder] = 0;

        // get last borrow order
        allActiveBorrowOrders[index] = allActiveBorrowOrders[
            activeOrdersCount - 1
        ];
        // take out last borrow order
        allActiveBorrowOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

        // switch index of the last borrow order to the deleted borrow order
        borrowOrderIndex[allActiveBorrowOrders[index]] = index;
        activeOrdersCount--;
    }
```

Thus the first element of the `allActiveBorrowOrders` gets deleted by the attacker. This attack can be repeated for greater impact.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker uses malicious contract to create borrow contract in borrow factory
2. The malicious contract calls the `createBorrowOrder` function in borrow factory that passes own address as collateral address.
3. The borrow order is created and `transferFrom` re-enters and `cancelOffer()` function is called which deletes the victim's borrow order at 0 index.

### Impact

The borrow order at index 0 is deleted by attacker other than owner of borrow order. De-listing the borrow orders on the `getActiveBorrowOrders` view method.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

follow CEI pattern in the borrow factory contract
