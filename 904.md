# When calculating the interest paid, precision loss can occur.

### Summary

When calculating interest, performing division first and then multiplication can lead to precision loss. Although the loss in interest might seem small initially, it can accumulate over time, resulting in a significant overall loss.

### Root Cause

When annual interest and interest are calculated separately, it can lead to precision loss. Here's an example to explain this:
- Suppose principleAmount = 1000, APR = 500 (5%), and activeTime = 60 days = 5184000 seconds.
- The annualInterest is calculated as:
  anualInterest = (offer.principleAmount * offer.apr) / 10000; = 50；
- Then, the interest is calculated as:
  interest = annualInterest × activeTime / 31536000≈8.22  However, due to precision loss, the result is rounded to interest = 8. 

If the principleAmount is much larger, the loss in interest will be even greater because the rounding error becomes more significant.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The user has a large principleAmount.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Leading to interest loss.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Increase an appropriate scaling factor.
 ```solidity
  uint scale = 1000;
 uint interest = (anualInterest * activeTime*1000) / 31536000;
```
  In this case, the example we mentioned earlier would be accurately calculated as interest = 8.22.
