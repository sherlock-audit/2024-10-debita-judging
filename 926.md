# TaxTokenReceipt.sol:: `deposit()` Will Always Revert When Depositing Fee On Transfer Tokens.

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L14-L20

According to the protocol, FoT tokens will be used specifically in `TaxTokenReceipt.sol` 
The issue is with the way the `deposit` function handles user deposits. The function first checks the balance before the transfer of tokens and then the balance after the tokens transfer. After which it compares the difference and checks in the deposit `amount` is greater or equal to the difference. 
FoTs however will always revert since the actual amount which the contract will receive would be slightly less than the actual amount sent which would mean it's inability to deposit successfully.

### Root Cause

- Not accounting for `fees` taken on some tokens ie FoT

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The token being deposited has to have a `fee on transfer`

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- This would alienate FoT tokens from the protocol which would be against the intentions of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- A slight margin can be given when calculating the `difference`
