# The ownership of AuctionFactory.sol can't change because shadowing variable

## Summary

The vulnerability in the `AuctionFactory.sol` contract lies in the `changeOwner()` function, where a local variable `owner` shadows the global variable `owner`. This leads to unexpected behavior that prevents ownership changes, rendering the ownership transfer functionality inoperable. 

## Vulnerability details

When we use the `AuctionFactory.sol`, the `owner` is set by the contract through filling the `owner` with `msg.sender`. This contract also perform to change the ownership. But, this contract doesn't perform as expected. Lets see code below : 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218-L222

However, this is vulnerable because the global variable `owner` is shadowed by the local variable `owner` in the function, leading to potential issues. Lets say i act like the owner then i'm going to change the ownership, i just call `AuctionFactory::changeOwner()` with filling the parameter `owner` with new owner. But this case will revert because this 

```sol
        // the  variable owner represents from local variable / memory variable
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
```

The contract check the `msg.sender` with the `owner` parameter. If we fill a different address with `msg.sender`, this code will revert. And if we fill with same of address, the ownership of contract will not change. It happens at : 
- `AuctionFactory.sol`
- `buyOrderFactory.sol`
- `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol`

## Impact

The ownership of this contract never change.

## PoC

```solidity
    function setUp() public {    
        vm.prank(oldOwner);
        factory = new auctionFactoryDebita();
    }

    function testOwnerCantChange() public {
        vm.prank(oldOwner);
        vm.expectRevert();
        factory.changeOwner(newOwner);

        vm.prank(oldOwner);
        factory.changeOwner(oldOwner);
    }
```

```bash

## Remediation

Rename local variable to avoid this

```diff
-    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
+    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
-      owner = owner;
+      owner = newOwner;
    }
```
