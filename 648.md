# borrower can exploit infinite loans from the same perpetualLender

### Summary

Perpetual Lend implies that the funds can be immediately re-used for the next loan as soon as they become available.

However, this opens up the possibility of malucious borrower to exploit such loans and in one transaction cancel the debt, and then re-open it.

Thus, the borrower can indefinitely not return the debt to lender.

Think this situation differs from intended design by one thing - apr, which borrower pays lender also go to lendOrder account and can also be reused immediately.

Thus, perpetual lendOrder will not even be able to deduct the interest earned on its deposit.

### Root Cause

Consider how the funds are [credited](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L233) to the lend order contract at the time of debt payment.
```solidity
uint interest = calculateInterestToPay(index);
            uint feeOnInterest = (interest * feeLender) / 10000;
            uint total = offer.principleAmount + interest - feeOnInterest;
            address currentOwnerOfOffer;
if (lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer) {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
                IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);
                lendOffer.addFunds(total);
            } else {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim =
                    interest -
                    feeOnInterest;
            }
```
We see that if perpetual debt - then the function addFunds() is called
```solidity
function addFunds(uint amount) public nonReentrant {
        require(
            msg.sender == lendInformation.owner ||
                IAggregator(aggregatorContract).isSenderALoan(msg.sender),
            "Only owner or loan"
        );
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        lendInformation.availableAmount += amount;
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
    }
```
Immediately after running addFunds lendOrder is again available to borrow from him.

The key point is that even the interest that the lender earned from this debt becomes available for withdrawal.

Thus, the borrower can take these funds again in the same transaction.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Borrower reuse perpetual lend order to not pay its debt in full, thus artificially extending the duration of its debt.
1. RepayDebt
2. internal call addFunds
3. In the same tx create matched borrowOffer
4. match borrowOffer with this lendOrder

### Impact

At first, it may seem that such behavior is intended behaviour, since perpetual debt implies reuse. However, this still breaks several principles of protocol.

1. Loan deadline in this case - this is a dummy measurement and the borrower can take as much as he wants - it breaks the main protocolâ€™s inversion that the only position health indicator is the deadline, here it can be ignored

2. The lender who gave the funds under perpetual - due to such behavior of the borrower will not have access to their funds for their withdrawal almost never.

I think issue deserves medium severity

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I think there may be several ways to avoid.

1. Add a temporary gap between addFunds and the moment when lend order can be used in the next transaction

2. During addFunds - split apr who paid borrower and principle amount. Thus, such an attack will be unprofitable for the borrower, since for each round he will LOSE apr. Also lender will have access to part of funds that he gave in lend order
