# `TaxTokensReceipt.sol` is incompatible with fee-on-transfer tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the contest readme, FoT tokens will be used in `TaxTokenReceipt.sol`
> We will interact with :

  > any ERC20 that follows exactly the standard (eg. 18/6 decimals)
  > Receipt tokens (All the interfaces from "contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/..")
  > USDC and USDT
  > Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in TaxTokensReceipt contract

 Fee-on-transfer tokens deduct a percentage of the transferred tokens as a fee, meaning the receiving address (in this case, the contract) will always receive fewer tokens than the amount specified in the `safeTransferFrom` call.

 The `deposit` function fails to properly account for tokens that apply a fee during transfers. Specifically, the function expects the full amount of tokens to be received by the contract, but with fee-on-transfer tokens, a portion of the transferred tokens is deducted as a fee. This discrepancy causes the function to revert, preventing deposits of such tokens. 

 The require condition in the `deposit` function enforces that the contract must receive at least the full `amount` specified:
 [TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L69](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L69) 

 ```js
function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
    uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
    SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
        ERC20(tokenAddress),
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        amount
    );
    uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
@>  require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed"); 
    tokenID++;
    tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount; 
    _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
    emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
    return tokenID;
}
``` 
This condition will fail for fee-on-transfer tokens, resulting in a transaction revert. 

## Impact
FoT tokens cannot be used in `TaxTokenReceipt.sol`

## Recommendation
Modify the require statement to correctly account for FoT tokens.
