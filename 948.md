# DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3 assumes principle and collateral price feeds have the same decimals

### Summary

`DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3` assumes that principle and collateral price feeds have the same decimals, this is clearly not the case as Debita is designed to work with different types of oracles eg. Chainlink , pyth and Mix(twap + pyth)


### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3` ln 350 expects the principle and collateral price feeds to have the same decimals and ` ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral` to be in 8 decimals

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L350-L362

```solidity
uint ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = (priceCollateral_BorrowOrder * 10 ** 8) / pricePrinciple
```

However because the protocol is designed to work with different types of oracles eg. Chainlink , pyth and Mix(twap + pyth), the principle and collateral price feeds may have different decimals and `ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral` will not be in 8 decimals.

It is important to note that `ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral` is used to determine the ltv ratio as seen here
```solidity
                // take 100% of the LTV and multiply by the LTV of the principle
                uint value = (ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral *
                    borrowInfo.LTVs[indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder[i]]) / 10000;

                /**
                 get the ratio for the amount of principle the borrower wants to borrow
                 fix the 8 decimals and get it on the principle decimals
                 */
                uint ratio = (value * (10 ** principleDecimals)) / (10 ** 8);
                ratiosForBorrower[i] = ratio;
```
which is supposed to be in principle token decimals and is used to calculate the amount of collateral used for the loan

```solidity
uint userUsedCollateral = (lendAmountPerOrder[i] * (10 ** decimalsCollateral)) / ratio;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

High - incorrect calculations leading to under/over collateralized loans due to incorrect ltv ratio

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Account for price decimals , eg:

```solidity
uint ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = ((priceCollateral_BorrowOrder * 10 ** 8) * 10 ** principlePriceDecimals) / pricePrinciple * 10 ** collateralPriceDecimals
```
