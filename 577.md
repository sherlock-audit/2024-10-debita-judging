# `TaxTokensReceipt` lacks support for all FoT tokens

### Summary

According to the README, three are no restrictions to what fee-on-transfer token is used to deploy `TaxTokensReceipt` contract. The code assumes that the FoT token for which `deposit()` is called set corresponding `TaxTokensReceipt` contract as exempt from tax. Unfortunately, this constraint is not possible for all FoT tokens and for them `deposit()` will always revert:

### Root Cause

As outlined in the README, the `TaxTokensReceipt` contract may be deployed for FoT tokens for which tax exemption will be impossible. 


### Internal pre-conditions

FoT token for which the `TaxTokensReceipt` contract was deployed does not have the functionality of freeing certain addresses from the transfer fee.


### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Creating receipt does not work for **all** FoT tokens, which should be true according to the README. 

### PoC

When transfer is made with FoT token, `balanceAfter - balanceBefore` will be less than the value of the transfer. Therefore this will revert:

### Mitigation

Verify that the tax exemption is activated in the constructor or ensure `TaxTokensReceipt` is deployed only for FoT tokens with this functionality accessible for that contract.
