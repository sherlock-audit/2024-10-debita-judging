# Attacker will de-list lend offers in LendOfferFactory

### Summary

The lend offer factory's `deleteOrder` assumes that the function will be called only once per lend offer implementation however this is false because of which the victim who would be in the 0 index of the `allActiveLendOrders` will have his/her lend order deleted.

The attack can be carried out by accident as well instead of just a motivated attacker.

### Root Cause

The lend offer implementation allows an user/attacker to call the `deleteOrder` function in lendOffer factory [twice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L184).

It can be called by the `changePerpetual` function or by `addFunds` and `cancelOffer` combination.
This can allow multiple deletions for a lend Offer in lend offer factory. Since the `LendOrderIndex` is set to 0 the first time.

The index from the second and succeeding time will always be zero, which means the first element. This will delete another user's lend offer from the lend offer factory effectively de-listing the lend offer entries from the `allActiveLendOrders` mapping.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

**Way 1**
1. The attacker creates a lend offer from lend offer factory
2. The attacker calls `cancelOffer`
3. The attacker adds funds through `addFunds`
4. The attacker calls `cancelOffer` again

**Way 2**
1. The attacker creates a lend offer from lend offer factory with 0 `_startedLendingAmount`
2. The attacker calls `changePerpetual(false)` repeatedly

### Impact

The protocol loses legitimate lend offers from `getActiveOrders()` function's result because of this DOS attack, forcing them to create lend offer contracts again if they want the orders to be listed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Create another way to deal with deleted lend-offers, by setting the `LendOrderIndex` value to `type(uint.max)` on deletion and handling the logic for deleted lend offers differently in lend offer factory.
