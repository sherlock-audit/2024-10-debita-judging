```solidity
function calculateInterestToPay(uint index) public view returns (uint) {
        infoOfOffers memory offer = loanData._acceptedOffers[index];
        uint anualInterest = (offer.principleAmount * offer.apr) / 10000;
        // check already duration
        uint activeTime = block.timestamp - loanData.startedAt;
        uint minimalDurationPayment = (loanData.initialDuration * 1000) / 10000;
        uint maxDuration = offer.maxDeadline - loanData.startedAt;
        if (activeTime > maxDuration) {
            activeTime = maxDuration;
        } else if (activeTime < minimalDurationPayment) {
            activeTime = minimalDurationPayment;
        }

        uint interest = (anualInterest * activeTime) / 31536000;

        // subtract already paid interest
        return interest - offer.interestPaid;
    }
```
