# User can make his veNFT unpokable by voting dust amount in some random pool

### Summary

User can make his veNFT unpokable by voting dust amount in some random pool. For this issue we should take look at the `Voter` contract's [`poke`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/lib/contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L194-L231) and [`vote`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/lib/contracts/contracts/Voter.sol#L251-L267) functions. By looking at the vote function we see that there is not reqiered minimum amount for voting. This means that a user can vote a dust amount for one pool and the other part of the weight to other pools and this will make the `poke` function revert every time. This can be seen in the `_vote` function which reverts on the following block of code:
```javascript
if (isGauge[_gauge]) {
  @>              uint256 _poolWeight = (_weights[i] * _weight) / _totalVoteWeight;
                if (votes[_tokenId][_pool] != 0) revert NonZeroVotes();
 @>               if (_poolWeight == 0) revert ZeroBalance();
                _updateFor(_gauge);

```
if a user vote with dust amount to some pool, this function will always revert due to `_poolWeight` rounding down to 0. This issue impact counts directly to the veNFT (respectively to the `veNFTVault` and `veNFTAerodrome`contacts) because it prevents the NFT from being poked, which means it's balance is never going to drop

### Root Cause

neither the `veNFTVault::vote` nor the `veNFTAerodrome::voteMultiple` function checks for a minimum amounts of voting weight.

### Internal pre-conditions

user votes with dust amount for a random pool

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User votes with dust amount for a random pool and with the other balance of the NFT votes for other pools 
2. When other user try to poke his NFT the poke function will always revert as described above

### Impact

User NFT becomes unpokeable, meaning that his NFT will have extraordinary amounts of voting power for future epochs 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set a minimum weight distribution as percentage of the total weight of the NFT. This way the user won't be able to do such thing
