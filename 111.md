# Ineffective Owner Update Logic in `changeOwner` Function

## Summary

The `changeOwner` function in the `AuctionFactory` contract fails to update the owner due to a logical error (`owner = owner;`), rendering it impossible to change the contract owner after deployment, even within the intended 6-hour window.

## Vulnerability Details

In `AuctionFactory` contract, there is a state variable `owner`
```js
address owner; // owner of the contract
```
Owner is set as msg.sender(contract deployer) in the constructor.
```js
 constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        feeAddress = msg.sender;
        deployedTime = block.timestamp;
    }
```
There is a [changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218-L222) function which allows changing the current owner to a new owner within 6 hours of the contract deployment.
```js
 function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner; //@audit  
    }
```
The statement `owner = owner;` is ineffective as it assigns the argument owner back to itself.

## Impact

Faulty `changeOwner` function. Owner of the contract cant be change after deployment

## Tools Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the argument to `newOwner` and assign it to the `owner` state variable
