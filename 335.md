# "Improper Handling of deleteOrder Will Disrupt Aggregator Services and Lock Lender Assets"

### Summary

Improper handling of the **`deleteOrder`** function may lead to abnormal states, preventing the Aggregator from providing lending services. This could also cause the lender to be unable to use the `cancelOffer` function to withdraw their assets, resulting in locked assets.

### Root Cause

In the **DebitaLendOffer** contract, the **cancelOffer** function will send the remaining **lendInformation.availableAmount** and call **DebitaLendOfferFactory.deleteOrder** to delete its own **lendOrder**. The specific logic is as follows:

```solidity
    function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder {
        uint index = LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder];
        LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder] = 0;

        // switch index of the last borrow order to the deleted borrow order
        allActiveLendOrders[index] = allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1];
        LendOrderIndex[allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]] = index;

        // take out last borrow order

        allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

        activeOrdersCount--;
    }
```

In the **deleteOrder** function, **LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder]** is set to 0. However, if **deleteOrder** is called again, even if **LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder]** is 0, it will still swap **allActiveLendOrders[0]** with **allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount-1]** and clear **allActiveLendOrders[0]**, which can result in the deletion of data that does not belong to the **lendOrder**. If **deleteOrder** is called repeatedly, it will clear all entries in **activeOrdersCount**, causing other users' data to be erased, and all data in **allActiveLendOrders** will be set to **address(0)**. This will cause **Aggregator** to fail when calling **DebitaLendOffer.acceptLendingOffer**, for the following reason:

```solidity
    function acceptLendingOffer(
        uint amount
    ) public onlyAggregator nonReentrant onlyAfterTimeOut {
        LendInfo memory m_lendInformation = lendInformation;
        uint previousAvailableAmount = m_lendInformation.availableAmount;
        require(
            amount <= m_lendInformation.availableAmount,
            "Amount exceeds available amount"
        );
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");

        lendInformation.availableAmount -= amount;
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(m_lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            amount
        );

        // offer has to be accepted 100% in order to be deleted
        if (
            lendInformation.availableAmount == 0 && !m_lendInformation.perpetual
        ) {
            isActive = false;
            IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
            IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
        } else {
            IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
        }

        // emit accepted event on factory
    }
```

When **`lendInformation.availableAmount == 0 && !m_lendInformation.perpetual`** is satisfied, the call to **`IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));`** will revert, because **activeOrdersCount** has already been set to 0, preventing the Aggregator from functioning properly.

Additionally, when the lender calls **cancelOffer** to withdraw their assets, the operation will also fail, causing the lender's assets to be locked.

### Impact

The Aggregator will be unable to provide lending services.

The lender will be unable to use the **cancelOffer** function to withdraw their assets, causing the assets to be locked.

### PoC

## 

```solidity
if activeOrdersCount =4

//caller:attacker
DebitaLendOffer.cancelOffer()->activeOrdersCount=3
DebitaLendOffer.addFunds(1)
DebitaLendOffer.cancelOffer()------------>activeOrdersCount=2
DebitaLendOffer.addFunds(1)
DebitaLendOffer.cancelOffer()------------>activeOrdersCount=1
DebitaLendOffer.addFunds(1)
DebitaLendOffer.cancelOffer()------------>activeOrdersCount=0
//caller:Aggregator         activeOrdersCount==0
DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3()
	call DebitaLendOffer.acceptLendingOffer(amount)
		call DebitaLendOfferFactory.deleteOrder ------------>revert

//caller:lender            activeOrdersCount==0
DebitaLendOffer.cancelOffer----------------->revert

```



### Mitigation

Add the line `isLendOrderLegit[address(lendOffer)] = false;` in the `deleteOrder` function.
