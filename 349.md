# M-2: `AuctionFactory::_deleteAuctionOrder` has an incorrect access control implementation, which could allow any user to delete an auction.

### Summary

The purpose of the `AuctionFactory::_deleteAuctionOrder` function is to delete a specific auction contract. However, due to an incorrect access control implementation, a malicious auction contract owner could delete other users' auction contracts.

### Root Cause

Due to the lack of validation for the `_AuctionOrder` parameter in the [AuctionFactory::_deleteAuctionOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L145-L160) function, a malicious user can create an auction and then delete the auctions of other users.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. In `Auction.sol`, the auction owner can use `cancelAuction` to cancel/delete their own auction record and return the NFT to the seller, preventing the NFT from being stuck in the contract.
2. However, due to incorrect access control in `AuctionFactory::_deleteAuctionOrder`, 
3. This allows malicious users to bypass the `cancelAuction` function, create an auction, and then use the `_deleteAuctionOrder` function to prematurely delete other users' auction records.

### Impact

A malicious user can create an auction and then delete the auction records of all other users.

### PoC

Attack scenario:

User A: Creates auction contract A  
User B: Creates auction contract B

At this point, auction contract B can:
1. Call `_deleteAuctionOrder(address(A))`
2. Since B is also an auction contract, it can pass the `onlyAuctions` check
3. This allows it to delete the auction-related indexes and records of contract A!

### Mitigation

Fix suggestion: Require that `msg.sender == _AuctionOrder` in order to call this function.


```diff
-    function _deleteAuctionOrder(address _AuctionOrder) external onlyAuctions {
+     require(msg.sender == _AuctionOrder,"Can only delete own auction");
        // get index of the Auction order
        uint index = AuctionOrderIndex[_AuctionOrder];
        AuctionOrderIndex[_AuctionOrder] = 0;

        // get last Auction order
        allActiveAuctionOrders[index] = allActiveAuctionOrders[
            activeOrdersCount - 1
        ];
        // take out last Auction order
        allActiveAuctionOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

        // switch index of the last Auction order to the deleted Auction order
        AuctionOrderIndex[allActiveAuctionOrders[index]] = index;
        activeOrdersCount--;
    }
```
