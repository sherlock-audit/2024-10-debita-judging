### Attack Path

Assume Bob's has a borrow order with a veAERO NFT with 10,000,000 AERO worth of locked amount.

Note that for borrow order with a NFT as its collateral, the order has to be completely matched within a single Loan, which is enforced via the check at Line 565 below within the `DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3` function. This means that you cannot break the borrow order into multiple Loans when the borrow order's collateral is NFT.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L565

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Aggregator.sol
274:     function matchOffersV3(
..SNIP..
562:         // if collateral is an NFT, check if the amount of collateral is within the limits
563:         // it has a 2% margin to make easier the matching, amountOfCollateral is the amount of collateral "consumed" and the valuableAssetAmount is the underlying amount of the NFT
564:         if (borrowInfo.isNFT) {
565:             require(
566:                 amountOfCollateral <=
567:                     (borrowInfo.valuableAssetAmount * 10200) / 10000 &&
568:                     amountOfCollateral >=
569:                     (borrowInfo.valuableAssetAmount * 9800) / 10000,
570:                 "Invalid collateral amount"
571:             );
572:         }
```

Due to the extremely high value of the borrow order, a total of 50 lend orders are needed to fulfill this specific borrow order within a single Loan. Per Lines 289 and 290 of the `DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3` function, up to 100 lend orders are supported. Thus, it is not an issue to have 50 lender orders.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L290

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Aggregator.sol
274:     function matchOffersV3(
275:         address[] memory lendOrders,
..SNIP..
283:     ) external nonReentrant returns (address) {
284:         // Add count
285:         loanID++;
286:         DBOImplementation.BorrowInfo memory borrowInfo = DBOImplementation(
287:             borrowOrder
288:         ).getBorrowInfo();
289:         // check lendOrder length is less than 100
290:         require(lendOrders.length <= 100, "Too many lend orders");
```

After matching all the 50 lender orders against Bob's borrow order, a new Loan contract will be created.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L585

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Aggregator.sol
274:     function matchOffersV3(
..SNIP..
585:         DebitaV3Loan deployedLoan = DebitaV3Loan(address(_loanProxy));
586:         // init loan
587:         deployedLoan.initialize(
588:             borrowInfo.collateral,
589:             principles,
590:             borrowInfo.isNFT,
591:             borrowInfo.receiptID,
592:             borrowInfo.isNFT ? 1 : amountOfCollateral,
593:             borrowInfo.valuableAssetAmount,
594:             amountOfCollateral,
595:             borrowInfo.valuableAsset,
596:             borrowInfo.duration,
597:             amountPerPrinciple,
598:             borrowID, //borrowInfo.id,
599:             offers,
600:             s_OwnershipContract,
601:             feeInterestLender,
602:             feeAddress
603:         );
```

However, the issue is that when the Loan contract is created, there is a check at Line 156 below. In this case, the check will revert because the number of lend offers exceeds 30. As a result, Bob's borrow order cannot be matched due to revert.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L156

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Loan.sol
138:     function initialize(
..SNIP..
150:         infoOfOffers[] memory _acceptedOffers,
151:         address m_OwnershipContract,
152:         uint feeInterestLender,
153:         address _feeAddress
154:     ) public initializer nonReentrant {
155:         // set LoanData and acceptedOffers
156:         require(_acceptedOffers.length < 30, "Too many offers");
```

### Impact

The following are the negative impacts:

- Core contract functionality is broken
- Loss of fee for the protocol as the protocol charges a fee against the total amount being matched.
