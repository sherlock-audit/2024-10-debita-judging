# Time-sensitive `DebitaLoan` contract does not check sequencer falls due to which borrowers may be eliminated through no fault of their own.

### Summary

The most important contract in the system - `DebitaV3Loan` which controls the loans created - does not account for sequencer work.

Given that loans in Debita are valid until the deadline, and immediately after the deadline the borrower cannot repay the loans and liquidation occurs - it is simply necessary to consider that the sequencer may crash and thus simply not allow the borrower to repay his loans.

This situation is not favourable to anyone.
- Borrowers lose their collateral
- Lenders do not receive principle and in case collateral is NFT - they are forced to put it to auction, where they may additionally lose funds
- The protocol does not receive the commissions it takes from each debt repayment
Given that the protocol did not clearly state in README - how to treat sequencer falls and given the fact that ' DebitaChainlink'- takes into account that the [sequencer may fall](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L49) - very strange that it does not make time-sensitive contract  'DebitaLoan' 

```solidity
function nextDeadline() public view returns (uint) {
        uint _nextDeadline;
        LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
        if (m_loan.extended) {
            for (uint i; i < m_loan._acceptedOffers.length; i++) {
                if (
                    _nextDeadline == 0 &&
                    m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].paid == false
                ) {
                    _nextDeadline = m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].maxDeadline;
                } else if (
                    m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].paid == false &&
                    _nextDeadline > m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].maxDeadline
                ) {
                    _nextDeadline = m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].maxDeadline;
                }
            }
        } else {
            _nextDeadline = m_loan.startedAt + m_loan.initialDuration;
        }
        return _nextDeadline;
    }
```

Thus, nextDeadline() does not take into account the sequencer status, so users whose loan was made during the period when the sequencer is unavailable will be immediately subject to liquidation when it becomes available.


### Root Cause

Time-sensitive contract does not check the sequencer status when counting nextDeadline().

### Internal pre-conditions

The debt was taken, the payment time of which fell sequencer

### External pre-conditions

Seqeuncer falls.

### Attack Path

User borrows c duration of 6 hours

Sequencer falls

The debt is immediately liquidated at the time of sequencer recovery

### Impact

When the only indicator of position health is the payment deadline and its latching inevitably leads to elimination - it is worth considering the sequencer status.



Impact High, Likelihood: Low - Severity: Medium

Again, because the protocol did not strictly affirm that problems with the sequencer are not valid and also the protocol in one of the contracts from scope takes into account the work of the sequencer - I think that the lack of this check in another contract of the protocol should be considered valid.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add sequencer status check
