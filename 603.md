# Sequencer Downtime Enables Below-Market Dutch Auction Purchases

### Summary

The lack of sequencer uptime validation in the Dutch auction mechanism will cause significant financial losses for sellers as malicious buyers can wait for sequencer downtime to purchase NFTs at artificially decreased prices when the sequencer resumes.

### Root Cause

In `auctions/Auction.sol`, the Dutch auction price calculation relies solely on `block.timestamp` without any sequencer uptime validation:

```solidity
function getCurrentPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
    dutchAuction_INFO memory m_currentAuction = s_CurrentAuction;
    
    if (block.timestamp >= m_currentAuction.endBlock) {
        return m_currentAuction.floorAmount;
    }
    
    uint256 elapsed = block.timestamp - m_currentAuction.initialBlock;
    uint256 discount = elapsed * m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock;
    
    return m_currentAuction.initAmount - discount;
}
```

The issue arises because:
1. Price decreases linearly based on `block.timestamp`
2. During sequencer downtime, `block.timestamp` continues to advance
3. No validation of sequencer status or timestamp gaps



### Internal pre-conditions

1. An active Dutch auction needs to exist in the protocol
2. The auction's initial price needs to be significantly higher than the floor price
3. The auction duration needs to be long enough to potentially encounter sequencer downtime


### External pre-conditions

1. L2 sequencer needs to go down for a significant period (e.g., >1 hour)
2. Price of the auctioned NFT/asset needs to remain stable or increase during sequencer downtime


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol and sellers suffer from unfair NFT sales at artificially low prices. Attackers can gain significant discounts by exploiting sequencer downtime to purchase NFTs at prices far below market value.

### PoC

### Mitigation

1. Add sequencer uptime validation
