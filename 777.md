# Control centralized through a single multisig address

### Summary

The contract `MixOracle` employs a single multisig address for critical actions, it introduces a significant risk by creating a single point of failure. If its compromised, a malicious actor could manipulate the crucial setting that leads to system-wide exploitation.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/MixOracle/MixOracle.sol#L20

In `MixOracle.sol:20` :potential single point of failure

### Impact

In `MixOracle`  multisig is set is msg.sender, and is capable of performing the following functions:

```solidity
function setAttachedTarotPriceOracle(address uniswapV2Pair) public {
        require(multisig == msg.sender, "Only multisig can set price feeds");
...}
 
function setManager(address manager, bool status) public {
        require(multisig == msg.sender, "Only multisig can set manager");
....}

function changeMultisig(address _newMultisig) public {
        require(multisig == msg.sender, "Only multisig can change multisig");
        

function reactivateContract() public {
        require(multisig == msg.sender, "Only multisig can change status");
   .....}

function reactivateStatusPriceId(address uniswapPair) public {
        require(multisig == msg.sender, "Only multisig can change status");
..}

```

Having a single owner of the contract is a large centralization risk and single point of failure.Consider changing to a multi-signature set-up or implement a governance contract.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate the centralization risk, it is recommended to implement multi-sig or governance contracts to distribute decision making authority, reducing the risk of single point of failure.
