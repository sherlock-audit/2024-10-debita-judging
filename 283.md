# Tarot oracle can be manipulated for low liquidity uniswap pairs

### Summary

Tarot oracle can be manipulated for low liquidity uniswap pairs. As stated in the [Tarot docs](https://docs.tarot.to/tarot-protocol/price-oracle), this oracle gets the price from uniswap pair using Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP). This is the best way to get the price but the oracle is still manipulatable if it gets the price from low liquidity pairs, which will most likely be the case here since the [`MixedOracle`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/MixOracle/MixOracle.sol#L19) will be used only for "strange" tokens that don't have pricefeeds on the two other oracles (As stated [here](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1305706586764742750/1306328781614747711)).

### Root Cause

Reading the cumulative price from `UniswapV2Pair` for low liquidity tokens

### Internal pre-conditions

the `MixOracle` is used

### External pre-conditions

the oracle reads the price from low liquidity pair

### Attack Path

1. malicious user gets a flashloan and swaps in the `UniswapV2Pair`, to manipulated the price of the pool
2. The manipulation is successful, despite that the oracle gets `TWAP` price and it is in favour of the user
3. The transaction goes through and a price far more suitable for the malicious user is applied to the protocol 
4. The user swaps back and returns the flashloan

### Impact

User can manipulate the price of an asset before a match of an offer, leading to more suitable price for him. In the README is listed that the price from `MixOracle` is allowed to have deviation of +- 5%. In cases like this the price can deviate even more which should be taken in consideration 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Don't use this oracle at all. It is better to not support some not relevant tokens than support them but have a manipulation possibility on them. Other possibility is to change the `Tarrot` oracle with an oracle with increased TWAP time. This way the cost for the attacker will be way higher than if the TWAP time is 20 minutes.
