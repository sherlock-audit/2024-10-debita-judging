# Loans with an initial duration of zero cannot be extended

### Summary

The inadequate checks in `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan()` do not allow loans with an initial duration of zero to be extended immediately, as the borrower might expect. Consequently, if a borrower attempts to match a borrow offer with a duration of zero to a compatible lend offer and extend the created loan in the same transaction, the call will revert.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Loan.sol:555](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L555) and [DebitaV3Loan.sol:562](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L562), the checks are inadequate. The second check ensures that `10%` of a loan's initial duration has elapsed, which is not possible for loans with an initial duration of zero.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A borrower calls `DBOFactory::createBorrowOrder()` to create a borrow order with a duration of 0.
2. The borrower then calls `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3()` to match their borrow order with a lend order. In the same transaction, they call `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan()` to extend the loan, but the call reverts.

### Impact

Borrowers will not be able to extend loans with a duration of zero which causes the loan to be defaulted.

### PoC

The following needs to be added to `BasicDebitaAggregator.t.sol`:
```solidity
DLOImplementation public FifthLendOrder;
DBOImplementation public ThirdBorrowOrder;
```

The following needs to be added to `BasicDebitaAggregator.t.sol::setUp()`:
```solidity
    vm.startPrank(secondLender);
    deal(AERO, address(secondLender), 1000e18, false);
    IERC20(AERO).approve(address(DLOFactoryContract), 1000e18);
    ratio[0] = 1e18;
    address FifthlendOrderAddress = DLOFactoryContract.createLendOrder(
        false,
        oraclesActivated,
        false,
        ltvs,
        1000,
        864000,
        0,
        acceptedPrinciples,
        AERO,
        oraclesPrinciples,
        ratio,
        address(0x0),
        5e18
    );
    vm.stopPrank();

    address ThirdborrowOrderAddress = DBOFactoryContract.createBorrowOrder(
        oraclesActivated,
        ltvs,
        1000,
        0,
        acceptedPrinciples,
        AERO,
        false,
        0,
        oraclesPrinciples,
        ratio,
        address(0x0),
        5e18
    );

    FifthLendOrder = DLOImplementation(FifthlendOrderAddress);
    ThirdBorrowOrder = DBOImplementation(ThirdborrowOrderAddress);
```

The following test should be added in `BasicDebitaAggregator.t.sol`:
```solidity
function testExtendLoanZeroDurationReverts() public {
    address[] memory lendOrders = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
    uint[] memory lendAmountPerOrder = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(
        1
    );
    uint[] memory porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder = allDynamicData
        .getDynamicUintArray(1);
    address[] memory principles = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
    uint[] memory indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder = allDynamicData
        .getDynamicUintArray(1);
    uint[] memory indexForCollateral_LendOrder = allDynamicData
        .getDynamicUintArray(1);
    uint[] memory indexPrinciple_LendOrder = allDynamicData
        .getDynamicUintArray(1);

    lendOrders[0] = address(FifthLendOrder);
    lendAmountPerOrder[0] = 5e18;
    porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder[0] = 10000;
    principles[0] = AERO;

    address loan = DebitaV3AggregatorContract.matchOffersV3(
        lendOrders,
        lendAmountPerOrder,
        porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder,
        address(ThirdBorrowOrder),
        principles,
        indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder,
        indexForCollateral_LendOrder,
        indexPrinciple_LendOrder
    );

    DebitaV3Loan loanContract = DebitaV3Loan(loan);
    IERC20(AERO).approve(address(loanContract), 1000e18);
    vm.expectRevert("Deadline passed to extend loan");
    loanContract.extendLoan();
}
```

### Mitigation

The mitigation is not as simple as changing the checks to allow equalityâ€”at least for the second one. Furthermore, a case distinction should be made in `extendLoan()` for loans with an initial duration of zero.
