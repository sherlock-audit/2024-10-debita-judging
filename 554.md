### Attack Path

Assume that Bob has earned 1000 XYZ tokens as an incentive. Thus, he proceeds to call the `claimIncentives` function below.

Line 196 will mark Bob to indicate that he has claimed the 1000 XYZ incentive.

Next, on Line 203 below, it will transfer 1000 XYZ incentive to Bob. However, due to a transfer error (which can occur due to many reasons, such as the XYZ token being temporarily paused by the XYZ protocol during an upgrade), the transfer did not occur and a `false` boolean is returned from the `XYZ.transfer` function, so Bob did not receive his 1000 XYZ.

After the failure, Bob wants to try claiming the 1000 XYZ again. However, the check at Line 185 will revert because `claimedIncentives[Bob] ` is already marked as True. Thus, there is no way for Bob to claim the 1000 XYZ incentive.

### Impact

High. Loss of assets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
- IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amountToClaim);
+ SafeERC20.safeTransfer(token, msg.sender, amountToClaim);
```
