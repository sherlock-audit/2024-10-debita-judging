# Missing `endBlock` Enforcement in  `Auction.sol`

## Summary
The Dutch Auction contract does not enforce a check for the auction's endBlock (expiration time). This allows users to interact with the auction, including purchasing the NFT or editing parameters, even after the auction should have ended. This flaw undermines the integrity of the auction system and exposes it to misuse.

## Vulnerability Details
**Affected Functions:**
- buyNFT

- editFloorPrice

- cancelAuction

**Issue:** None of these functions validate whether the current block timestamp (block.timestamp) exceeds the endBlock of the auction.

## Impact
**Unauthorized Purchases:** Users can buy the NFT at an expired price, often at the floor price, exploiting the lack of a valid auction period.
**Parameter Manipulation:** Auction owners can edit the floor price or duration of an expired auction to prolong its activity unfairly.
**Misleading Auction Status:** Participants may believe the auction is still active, leading to confusion and potential financial loss.
**System Inefficiency:** Expired auctions remain in the system, bloating the auction factory and causing unnecessary operational load.
## Recommendation
**Add endBlock Check:**
Create a modifier, onlyBeforeEnd, to enforce expiration logic:
```solidity
modifier onlyBeforeEnd() {
    require(block.timestamp <= s_CurrentAuction.endBlock, "Auction expired");
    _;
}
```
Apply this modifier to critical functions (buyNFT, editFloorPrice, and cancelAuction).

**Graceful Expiry Handling:**
Implement an expireAuction function to deactivate expired auctions and clean up factory records:
```solidity
function expireAuction() public {
    if (block.timestamp > s_CurrentAuction.endBlock && s_CurrentAuction.isActive) {
        s_CurrentAuction.isActive = false;
        auctionFactory(factory)._deleteAuctionOrder(address(this));
        auctionFactory(factory).emitAuctionDeleted(address(this), s_ownerOfAuction);
    }
}
```
