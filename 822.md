# sold  `NFTs` will get stuck in `buyOrder` contract




### Summary

The sold `NFTs` will get stuck in `buyOrder` contract and the `buyer` will never be able to receive that `NFT`.

### Root Cause

When a user wants to buy a `NFT` using `buyOrder`, he will first mention the `token` address , the `amount` and the `ratio` he is willng to give for the sepcified `NFT`.
User calls `createBuyOrder()`  with those given params from the `buyOrderFactory` to create the `buyOrder` implementation contract and funds are transferred to the newly created `buyOrder` contract. The `caller`/`buyer` is made the `owner` of the new contract.

Now a `seller` who is willing to sell his `NFT` for the specified amount, calls `sellNFT(receiptID)` from the the `buyOrder` contract.

```soldiity
    function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
            require(buyInformation.isActive, "Buy order is not active");
            require(
                buyInformation.availableAmount > 0,
                "Buy order is not available"
            );

            IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                receiptID
            ); //@audit-issue wantedToken is transferred to current contract and stuck there , instead it should transfer to the owner.
            ...
    }
```

Here, the contract transfers the `NFT` from the `seller` to the `buyOrder`(`address(this)`) contract instead of the  `owner` who is the actual `buyer`. 

Now , the `NFT` got stuck in the `buyOrder` contract and theres no way for the `buyer`/`owner` to retrieve the `NFT`.

there is no function that helps the `owner` to retrieve those stucked `NFT` from the `buyOrder` contract.

### Internal pre-conditions
User creates buyOrder contract and a seller decides to sell his NFT to buy the buyOrder.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The user who uses `buyOrder` contract to create a `buyOrder` will suffer from `100% loss of funds`. Happens because user will never receive the mentioned `NFT` ever and will always be stuck inside the `buyOrder` contract.


### PoC
_No response_

### Mitigation
```solidity
IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                buyInformation.owner,  //instead of address(this)
                receiptID
            );
```
