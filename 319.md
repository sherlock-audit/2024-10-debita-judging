# Unnecessary Formula Will Revert Extending Loans.

### Summary

The `DevitaV3Loan::extendLoan()` function contains a unnecessary formula that may cause an underflow in certain conditions, leading to a DOS for the function.

### Root Cause

- The issue lies in the [DevitaV3Loan::extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L590-L592) function, where the following calculation is performed:
```solidity
    uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline -
        alreadyUsedTime - 
        block.timestamp;
```
- The variable `extendedTime` is not used elsewhere in the function.
- However, this calculation can underflow if `alreadyUsedTime` exceeds `offer.maxDeadline - block.timestamp`, causing the function to revert.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Suppose the maximum loan duration (`offer.maxDeadline`) is 30 days.
2. After `20 days`, the borrower attempts to extend the loan.
3. At this point:
    - `alreadyUsedTime = 20 days`
    - `offer.maxDeadline - block.timestamp = 10 days`
4. Since `20 days > 10 days`, the subtraction in the formula underflows, causing the function to revert.


### Impact

- The borrower cannot extend the loan, breaking the contract's functionality.
- This results in borrower liquidation, leading to a potential loss of funds.


### PoC

### Mitigation

It is recommended to remove the unnecessary formula.
