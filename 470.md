# Auctioned `taxTokensReceipt` NFT Blocks Last Claimant Due to Insufficient Funds

### Summary

In the [`Auction::buyNFT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L109) function, users can purchase the current NFT in an auction using the same type of tokens as the underlying asset of the NFT. For example, `taxTokensReceipt` created with FoT tokens must be bought with the same FoT tokens.

During the execution of this function, a `transferFrom()` is performed to transfer funds from the buyer to the auction owner (loan contract). However, it does not account for fees applied during the transfer:

```solidity
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
            msg.sender,
            s_ownerOfAuction,
>>          currentPrice - feeAmount // feeAmount: Fee for the protocol
        );
```
Later in the function, it calls [DebitaV3Loan::handleAuctionSell](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L318) to distribute the collateral received from the buyer among the parties involved in the loan:
```solidity
        if (m_currentAuction.isLiquidation) {
            debitaLoan(s_ownerOfAuction).handleAuctionSell(
>>              currentPrice - feeAmount
            );
        }
```

The issue arises because the auction contract does not consider the fee on transfer when selling an auctioned `taxTokensReceipt` NFT. As a result, the final person attempting to claim their share of the collateral on the loan contract will encounter a revert due to insufficient funds.

### Root Cause

Not accounting for the fee on transfer when purchasing a `taxTokensReceipt` NFT being auctioned.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Creation a `taxTokenReceipt` NFT with an FoT token.
- Use this `taxTokenReceipt` NFT as collateral in a loan with multiple lenders.
- The loan defaults and the collateral is auctioned.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- **FoT Token Fee:** 1% fee on every transfer.

#### Steps:
1. The borrower creates a `taxTokensReceipt` NFT wrapping **10,000 FoT tokens**.
2. This NFT is used as collateral in a loan with multiple lenders.
3. At the end of the loan, the borrower defaults and auctions the NFT.
4. During the auction, another user buys the NFT for **7,000 FoT**, but due to the FoT token's transfer fee, the loan contract receives only **6,930 FoT**.
5. Inside `handleAuctionSell()`, the system calculates an inflated `tokenPerCollateralUsed` value (used to split collateral among the remaining claimants) because it doesn't account for the transfer fee.
6. **Impact:** When multiple lenders attempt to claim their share of the collateral, the last lender is unable to claim due to insufficient funds in the contract.

### Impact

The last person attempting to claim the collateral in the loan will be unable to do so.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Take into account the fee on transfer when buying the `taxTokenReceipt` NFT.
