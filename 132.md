# Precision Loss in `MixOracle`

Precision Loss in `MixOracle`

[**Location:** `contracts/oracles/MixOracle/MixOracle.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/MixOracle/MixOracle.sol#L60-L66)

**Issue:**

The `MixOracle` contract's price calculation may suffer from precision loss due to integer division and lacks safeguards against potential overflow. Specifically, the calculations involve large numbers and multiple divisions, which can truncate decimal places and result in inaccurate pricing. Additionally, there's no validation to ensure that the computed price meets a minimum acceptable value.

**Code Snippet:**

```solidity
int amountOfAttached = int(
    (((2 ** 112)) * (10 ** decimalsToken1)) / twapPrice112x112
);

uint price = (uint(amountOfAttached) * uint(attachedTokenPrice)) /
    (10 ** decimalsToken1);
```

**Impact:**

- **Precision Loss:**
  - Integer division in Solidity truncates decimals, leading to potential loss of significant digits.
  - This can cause the oracle to report incorrect prices, affecting trading decisions and contract interactions.

- **No Minimum Price Checks:**
  - Without validation, extremely low or zero prices might be accepted, posing financial risks to the protocol and its users.

- **Overflow Risks:**
  - Calculations involving `2 ** 112` can exceed the maximum value of integer types, leading to overflows.

**Recommendation:**

1. **Use Higher Precision in Calculations:**

   Introduce a high-precision multiplier to maintain decimal accuracy throughout the computation.

   ```solidity
   function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public returns (int) {
       uint256 constant PRECISION = 1e18;
       
       int amountOfAttached = int(
           (((2 ** 112)) * (10 ** decimalsToken1) * PRECISION) / twapPrice112x112
       );

       uint price = (uint(amountOfAttached) * uint(attachedTokenPrice)) /
           (10 ** decimalsToken1);
           
       price = price / PRECISION;
       
       require(price >= MIN_VALID_PRICE, "Price below minimum");
       return int(price);
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Minimum Price Validation:**

   Ensure that the calculated price is above a predefined threshold.

   ```solidity
   uint256 public constant MIN_VALID_PRICE = 1e8; // Example minimum price

   require(price >= MIN_VALID_PRICE, "Price below acceptable minimum");
   ```

3. **Use SafeMath Libraries or Solidity 0.8.0+:**

   Utilize overflow-checked arithmetic to prevent overflows.

   ```solidity
   // For Solidity versions <0.8.0
   using SafeMath for uint256;

   // For Solidity 0.8.0 and above, overflow checks are built-in
   ```
