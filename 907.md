# Unusable Ownership Transfer Due to Parameter Shadowing Across Multiple Contracts.

### Summary

Three contracts (`DebitaV3Aggregator.sol`, `AuctionFactory.sol`, and `BuyOrderFactory.sol`) contain a `changeOwner` function that fails to update the state variable `owner` due to parameter shadowing. This issue renders the ownership transfer mechanism ineffective, potentially allowing the existing owner to lose control over the contract if the vulnerability is exploited.

### Affected Code
**File**: `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol`  
**Function**: `changeOwner`  
**Line**: 707

### Root Cause

The function parameter `owner` in the `changeOwner` function shadows the contract's state variable `owner`. This results in the assignment `owner = owner` updating the parameter instead of the state variable, leaving the ownership state unchanged.

### Affected Code Pattern:  
```javascript
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner;  // Parameter shadowing prevents state update
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

# INTERNAL PRECONDITION  
1. The contract's `changeOwner` function is callable.  
2. The function relies on the `owner` state variable for authorization and state update.  
3. The state variable `owner` remains unaltered despite the function being called.  


### External pre-conditions

1. The contract has no safeguards (e.g., naming conventions or clear parameter differentiation) to prevent parameter shadowing.  

### Attack Path

# ATTACK PATH  
1. The Owner calls the `changeOwner` function with a valid address, intending to transfer ownership.  
2. The parameter `owner` shadows the state variable, so the assignment does not update the state variable.  
3. The existing owner retains ownership, or the function fails silently without achieving the intended effect.  

### Impact

the failure to transfer ownership effectively locks the contract's governance to the current owner.
This can lead to an operational deadlock, to a certain address or exploitation if the current owner loses access to their private key or malicious actors exploit the ineffective check to maintain control over the contract.

### PoC

```solidity
function testChangeOwner() public {
    address thief = makeAddr("thief");
    vm.startPrank(thief);
    DebitaV3AggregatorContract.changeOwner(thief);
    vm.stopPrank();
    console.log("Address of the thief", thief);
    console.log("Address of the contract owner", DebitaV3AggregatorContract.returnOwner());
}
```


### Mitigation

1. **Avoid Parameter Shadowing**:  
   - Use a different name for the function parameter (e.g., `newOwner`) to distinguish it from the state variable.  
   ```solidity
   function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
       require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
       require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
       owner = newOwner;
   }
   ```
