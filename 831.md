# Pyth oracle not validating confidence ratio

### Summary

Debita Pyth oracle can return stale prices do to the improper validation, which can result in attackers or users taking advantage of invalid prices.

### Vulnerability Details

Considering a provided price `p`, its confidence interval `σ` is roughly the standard deviation of the price's probability distribution. 
The official documentation of [best practices](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals) of the Pyth Price Feeds recommends some ways in which this confidence interval can be utilized for enhanced security. For example, the protocol can compute the value `σ / p` to decide the level of the price's uncertainty and disallow user interaction with the system in case this value exceeds some threshold.

Values of differents price feeds can be looked at [Pyth Price-Feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds) page.

Example for [ETH/USD](https://www.pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-eth-usd) at the time of writing this report:

```solidity
// Normal Market Condition (Current ETH price)
price = 347445000000    // $3,474.45 with -8 expo
expo = -8
conf = 300500000       // $3.005 with same expo (0.086% uncertainty)

priceMultiplier = 10^8
actualPrice = 347445000000 * 10^8 = 347445_0000000000000000
actualConf = 300500000 * 10^8 = 30050_0000000000000
confidenceRatio = actualPrice / actualConf = 1156  // Very healthy market

// Extreme Market Condition
price = 347445000000    // Still $3,474.45 but during high volatility
expo = -8
conf = 34744500000     // $347.445 with same expo (10% uncertainty)

actualPrice = 347445000000 * 10^8 = 347445_0000000000000000
actualConf = 34744500000 * 10^8 = 3474450_0000000000000
confidenceRatio actualPrice / actualConf = 10    // Very low confidence
```

### Impact

Without confidence interval contract can accept untrusted prices. Leading to attackers or users using untrusted prices in their advantage.

### Recommendation

Currently, the protocol completely ignores the confidence interval provided by the price feed. Consider utilizing the confidence interval provided by the Pyth price feed as recommended in the official documentation. This would help mitigate the possibility of attackers or users taking advantage of invalid prices: 

```solidity
    function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        bytes32 _priceFeed = priceIdPerToken[tokenAddress];
        require(_priceFeed != bytes32(0), "Price feed not set");
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        
        // Get the price from the pyth contract, no older than 90 seconds
        PythStructs.Price memory priceData = pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan(
            _priceFeed,
            600
        );

        // Check if the price feed is available and the price is valid
        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(priceData.price > 0, "Invalid price");
        
+       uint256 confidenceRatio = uint256(priceData.price) / priceData.conf;
+			  require(confidenceRatio >= MIN_CONFIDENCE_RATIO, "Price confidence is too low");
        
        return priceData.price;
    }
```

Where:

`MIN_CONFIDENCE_RATIO` should be a trusted minimum value for the protocol.
