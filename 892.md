# `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol::matchcOffersV3()` shouldn't be called by creater of borrowOrder as he can drain out all funds.

### Summary


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274

if be break down how connecter fee and interet amount is calculated we will get something like -

```js
    // uint interest = (anualInterest * activeTime) / 31536000;
    // interest = ([(offer.principleAmount * offer.apr)] / 10000 * activeTime) / 31536000;
    // interest = ([(offer.principleAmount * offer.apr)] * activeTime) / 315360000000;


    // feeToConnector = ((sigma(lendAmountPerOrder[i])*((borrowInfo.duration * 4) / 86400)/10000)*1500)/10000
    // feeToConnector = ((sigma(lendAmountPerOrder[i])*((borrowInfo.duration * 6000) / 86400)/10000))/10000
    // feeToConnector = ((sigma(lendAmountPerOrder[i])*((borrowInfo.duration * 6) / 8640000000) 1440000000
    // feeToConnector = ((sigma(lendAmountPerOrder[i])*((borrowInfo.duration / 1440000000
```

and if compare interest and feeToConnector, we will notice that feetoConnecter can be higher than the accumulated interest amount.

So, if the creater of borrow order calls the `matchOffersV3()` then he will ends up getting higher amount than paying it as the debt.

### Root Cause

The borrowOrder creater can call `matchOffersV3()`.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

All the funds can be drained from lend principle, if he continues to do it again and again.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

restrict borrowOrder creater to call this function.
