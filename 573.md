# NFT liquidation design flaw leads to borrower default chain reaction

### Summary

The design choice to liquidate the  NFT collateral upon a single loan default may cause a significant loss for borrowers and lenders as borrowers will have no incentive to repay remaining non-defaulted loans after their NFT is sold at a  very low price in a Dutch auction.

### Root Cause

function createAuctionForCollateral:

function createAuction:

The design to liquidate the  NFT collateral for a single loan default may creates a negative feedback loop where:
1. One defaulted loan triggers  NFT liquidation
2. NFT likely sells  very low value in Dutch auction
3. Borrower loses incentive to repay remaining healthy loans
4. More loans default unnecessarily

### Attack Path

1. Borrower takes multiple loans using a single NFT as collateral
2. One loan defaults, triggering NFT liquidation
`DebitaV3Loan.sol`
```solidity
require(nextDeadline() < block.timestamp, "Deadline not passed");
require(m_loan.auctionInitialized == false, "Already initialized");
```
3. Entire NFT is auctioned via Dutch auction mechanism:
`Auction.sol`
```solidity
function getCurrentPrice() public view returns (uint) {
//...
    uint decreasedAmount = m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock * timePassed;
    uint currentPrice = (decreasedAmount >
        (m_currentAuction.initAmount - floorPrice))
        ? floorPrice 
        : m_currentAuction.initAmount - decreasedAmount;
//...
}
```
4. NFT likely sells very low value due to Dutch auction price decay
5. Borrower has no incentive to repay remaining healthy loans since the collateral in very low value 
6. Additional loans default unnecessarily

### Impact

The borrowers may suffer much loss of their NFT collateral value when  one loan defaults. The lenders of non-defaulted loans also suffer losses as borrowers abandon repayment after NFT liquidation. This creates a negative spiral of unnecessary defaults.
