# Unused parameters in DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan() results in the function reverting in certain cases

### Summary

In the ``DebitaV3Loan.sol`` contract borrowers can extend their loans by calling the [extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function. However there are some random time calculations that are not utilized anywhere in the function, that in many cases will lead to the function reverting, and thus the borrower not being able to extend his loan. 
```solidity
    function extendLoan() public {
        ...

        for (uint i; i < m_loan._acceptedOffers.length; i++) {
            infoOfOffers memory offer = m_loan._acceptedOffers[i];
            // if paid, skip
            // if not paid, calculate interest to pay
            if (!offer.paid) {
                uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;

                uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline -
                    alreadyUsedTime -
                    block.timestamp;
                uint interestOfUsedTime = calculateInterestToPay(i);
                ...
    }
```
Let's consider the following example, seconds are used as the measure units to simplify the example:
 - When the loan was matched the block.timestamp is equal to 100 seconds, this represents the m_loan.startedAt param
 - The duration for the loan set by the borrower is 12 seconds
 - The max deadline for the lend offer is 20 seconds, given the loan was created at block.timestamp 100 seconds the offer.maxDeadline is 120 seconds. 
 - Now 11 seconds have passed and the current block.timestamp is 111 seconds. The borrower decides he wants to extend his loan to be valid for a total of 20 seconds, he should be able to, as this is the maxDeadline specified by the lender.
 - However if we perform the calculations from the above code snippet we will get the following:
   - **alreadyUsedTime** = 111 - 100 = 11
   - **extendedTime** = 120 - 11 - 111 = 120 - 122 = -2
   
As can be seen from the above example this will result in an underflow and the function will revert. This is not some specific edge case, if borrowers extend their loans close to the expiration of the initial loan duration of their loans, it is highly possible that the [extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function will revert. Keep in mind in one loan there are many lend offers, and each may have a different max duration. 

### Root Cause

In the [extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function there are some random calculations that are not used anywhere. However in many cases those calculations result in an underflow error and the [extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function reverts.

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Based on the parameters of the loan, after some time has passed borrowers won't be able to extend their loan. This is a critical functionality of the loan, as loans in Debita can be liquidated only after their duration has passed.

### Mitigation

In the [extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function remove those calcualtions as they are not used anywhere
```solidity
                uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;

                uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline -
                    alreadyUsedTime -
                    block.timestamp;
