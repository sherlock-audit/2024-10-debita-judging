# Front-running prevents lenders from changing perpetual status of orders

### Summary

Whenever a lender calls [DLOImplementation::changePerpetual()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L178-L188) to change the perpetual status of their lend order from `false` to `true`, anyone can front-run this by calling `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3()` to match the lend order with a borrow order.
This prevents the perpetual status from being changed.

### Root Cause

In `DLOImplementation:131`, the lend order is marked as inactive if its perpetual status is currently set to `false` and the available amount is `0`. This causes calls to change the perpetual status of the lend order to revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A borrow order compatible with the lend order must be available. If not, the user could create a compatible one in their front-running call.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. LenderA calls `DLOFactory::createLendOrder()` to create a non-perpetual LendOrderA.
2. In the future, LenderA decides to use the perpetual feature of the protocol and calls `DLOImplementation::changePerpetual()` to set the perpetual status of the not fully filled LendOrderA to `true`.
3. A malicious actor front-runs this call by matching LendOrderA with a compatible borrow order, fully filling LendOrderA. As a result, the perpetual status cannot be changed.

### Impact

Lenders will not be able to change the perpetual status of their lend order to `true` once it is set to `false`.
This means the perpetual lend order feature will not be available for some orders. Lenders need to create perpetual lend orders from the beginning if they wish to use that feature. If their only available funds are tied up in a lend order whose perpetual status they wanted to change to `true`, they would need to wait for the borrower to repay the debt before creating a new perpetual lend order. This process could take months.

### PoC

Add the following test to `BasicDebitaAggregator.t.sol`:

```solidity
function testChangePerpetualRevert() public {
    address[] memory lendOrders = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
    uint[] memory lendAmountPerOrder = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(
        1
    );
    uint[] memory porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder = allDynamicData
        .getDynamicUintArray(1);
    address[] memory principles = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
    uint[] memory indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder = allDynamicData
        .getDynamicUintArray(1);
    uint[] memory indexForCollateral_LendOrder = allDynamicData
        .getDynamicUintArray(1);
    uint[] memory indexPrinciple_LendOrder = allDynamicData
        .getDynamicUintArray(1);

    lendOrders[0] = address(LendOrder);
    lendAmountPerOrder[0] = 5e18;
    porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder[0] = 10000;
    principles[0] = AERO;

    address loan = DebitaV3AggregatorContract.matchOffersV3(
        lendOrders,
        lendAmountPerOrder,
        porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder,
        address(BorrowOrder),
        principles,
        indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder,
        indexForCollateral_LendOrder,
        indexPrinciple_LendOrder
    );

    vm.expectRevert("Offer is not active");
    LendOrder.changePerpetual(true);
}
```

### Mitigation

A mitigation for this vulnerability cannot be easily implemented. It should be considered allowing lenders to change the perpetual status of their lend orders even when they are fully filled, as funds can still be added when the lend order is inactive.
