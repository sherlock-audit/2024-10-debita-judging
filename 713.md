# Fee-on-Transfer Tokens Cause Deposit Reversion in `TaxTokensReceipts.sol`

### Summary

Per readme:

> - Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in TaxTokensReceipt contract

The missing adjustment for fee-on-transfer (FOT) tokens in `TaxTokensReceipts.sol` will cause deposits to revert for users depositing such tokens as the contract assumes the transferred amount matches the specified amount. This happens because the difference between the contract's balance before and after the transfer is always less than the user's specified amount due to the fee mechanism of FOT tokens.

### Root Cause

In TaxTokensReceipts.sol:69, the require statement:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L69

```solidity
        require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
```
assumes the contract receives the full `amount` of tokens specified by the user. For FOT tokens, a portion of the transferred tokens is deducted as a fee, so the actual amount received (`difference`) is always less than amount, causing the transaction to revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User Condition: The user attempts to deposit fee-on-transfer tokens (tokens that deduct a portion of the transfer as a fee).
2. Contract State: The `TaxTokensReceipts` contract must not account for the possibility of FOT tokens and directly compares the `difference` to the `amount`.

### External pre-conditions

Token Condition: The token being deposited must implement a fee-on-transfer mechanism that reduces the transferred amount.

### Attack Path

1. A user attempts to call the [`deposit()` function, specifying an amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L59) of FOT tokens to deposit.
2. The [`SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L61-L66) executes successfully, transferring the tokens from the user to the contract but deducting a fee.
3. The contract calculates the [`difference`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L68) between the balance before and after the transfer.
4. The [`require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L69) check fails because the actual received amount (`difference`) is less than the specified amount due to the fee mechanism.
The transaction reverts, making it impossible for users to deposit FOT tokens.

### Impact

The affected party (users) cannot deposit fee-on-transfer tokens into the `TaxTokensReceipts` contract. This effectively excludes such tokens from being used in the protocol, impacting protocol compatibility and user experience.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `deposit` function in `TaxTokensReceipts.sol` to accept the actual received amount (`difference`) rather than requiring it to match the user-specified amount:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L69-L71

```diff
-        require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
+        require(difference > 0, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
-        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
+        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = difference;
```
This adjustment ensures the function handles fee-on-transfer tokens correctly by storing and working with the actual amount received instead of the intended transfer amount.
