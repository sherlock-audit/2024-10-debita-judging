# Similar lack of validation in DLOFactory and in DBOFactory leads

### Summary

The `deleteOrder` functions only check the legitimacy of the borrower/lender but not the owners of the submitted orders, which leads to the possibility for once legitimate orders to delete other people's orders/replace them with their own orders.

### Root Cause

The following functions check only if borrower/lender are legit but not the owners of provided Orders:

### Internal pre-conditions

The following modifers can be passed if we had succsessfully created borrow/lend order once.

Once we create an order we can delete all others orders

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. succsessfully call `createBorrowOrder()`/`createLendOrder()`

next there's two attack paths
2.1 delete all `allActiveBorrowOrders[]`
2.2 replace some order with yours because it's possible to some orders to decrease `activeOrdersCount` variable and overwrite already existed order

### Impact

The impact of deleting someone's order is critical because it gives us abillity to greaf orders(take away opportunity to use protocol by blocking matching functionallity), break off-chain soft (`getActiveOrders()`)

The impact of replacing someone's order is also critical cause it gives us ability to replace order before matching to  earn yeild instead of initial order's creator, 

also it possible to provide malicious order instead of initial - i've decided not to escalate this type of impact, but it's also possible in case of this scenario, remember the main impact - delete/replace someone's order

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add nessasary checs in delete functions
