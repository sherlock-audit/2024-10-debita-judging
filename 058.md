# Can't change owner of multiple contracts

### Summary

[The Shadowing Effect](https://solstep.gitbook.io/solidity-steps/step-3/27-the-shadowing-effect) explained.
The `storage owner` value is never changed inside the function.
This renders the changeOwner() function, utilized across several contracts, entirely unusable.

Furthermore, if a governance system is introduced later, transferring ownership to a DAO or governance contract would be impossible.

### Root Cause

In  [AuctionFactory.changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218C1-L222C6),[buyOrderFactory.changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186C1-L190C6),[DebitaV3Aggregator.changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682)  we encounter The Shadowing Effect, preventing us from updating the owner of these contracts

### Impact

Core contract behaviour is broken

### PoC

In `test/fork/BuyOrders/BuyOrder.t.sol`

```solidity
    function testTryToChangeOwner() public {
        address newOwner = 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045;
        address currentOwner = factory.owner(); 
        vm.startPrank(currentOwner);
        // even currentOwner is unable to change owner
        vm.expectRevert("Only owner");
        factory.changeOwner(newOwner);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // we can also call the method as a random user
        vm.startPrank(newOwner);
        factory.changeOwner(newOwner);
        // ownership of the contract has not changed
        assertEq(currentOwner, factory.owner());
   }
```


The same could be done for the other two contracts.

### Mitigation

In all three contracts: 
```solidity
-   function changeOwner(address owner) public {
+   function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
-      owner = owner;
+      owner = _owner;
    }
```

It is also advised to make ownership transfer a two-step process such as by using the [Ownable2Step](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol) contract by Openzeppelin.
