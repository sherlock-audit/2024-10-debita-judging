# Inconsistent Arrays validation and missing 'isActive' check in 'updateBorrowOrder'

## Summary
The missing active status check and inconsistent array validation in `updateBorrowOrder` will cause potential manipulation of inactive orders and data corruption for borrowers .

## Root Cause
In [DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol:232-252](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L232-L253)  there are two critical issues:

- The missing active status check before allowing order updates, as the function does not verify the activeness of the borrow order before allowing updates 

- The inconsistent array length validation between creation and update flows. When creating a borrow order, the lengths of _LTVs and _ratios are validated to ensure they match the length of _acceptedPrinciples. However, in the updateBorrowOrder function, the validation checks if newRatios.length matches newLTVs.length instead of ensuring it aligns with the length of acceptedPrinciples.


## Impact
- The borrowers suffer potential manipulation of their inactive orders and data corruption. 
- This Inconsistency leads to incomplete data and runtime errors.

## Mitigation
- Add active status check:

```solidity
require(isActive, "Offer is not active");
```

- Add consistent array length validation:
```solidity
require(
    newLTVs.length == borrowInformation.acceptedPrinciples.length,
    "Invalid LTVs length"
);
require(
    newRatios.length == borrowInformation.acceptedPrinciples.length,
    "Invalid ratios length"
);
```
