# `addFunds()` can be called on an inactive lend order leading to deleted lend offer still being usable for matching

### Summary

`cancelOffer()` functions in both `DBOImplementation` and `DLOImplementation` contracts are meant to permanently disactivate given borrow/lend orders. Although they successfully set `isActive` variable to `false`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L149
, they fail to update `isBorrowOrderLegit` and `isLendOrderLegit` mappings on the factory contracts. 

The lend order has an `addFunds()` function that allows the increase of `availableAmount`. Because this function and `acceptLendingOffer()` fail to revert when `isActive` is `false`, the canceled lend offer can be successfully used in `matchOffersV3()`. 

As the borrow order does not have such `addFunds()` functionality it can be used in `matchOffersV3()` and pass `isBorrowOrderLegit` check, but it'll fail when `acceptBorrowOffer()` is called because `availableAmount` is still set to 0 after cancelation. So the root cause's impact is limited to lend offers. 

### Root Cause

- `isBorrowOrderLegit` and `isLendOrderLegit` mappings for deleted orders are not set to `false` in `deleteOrder()` and `deleteBorrowOrder()` functions leading to `matchOffersV3()` having insufficient order validation
- `addFunds()`, `acceptLendingOffer()`, and `cancelOffer()` can be called when if `isActive` is `false` in `DLOImplementation` contract


### Internal pre-conditions

- lend offer is canceled and then included for offer matching, either by a random user or the owner of the lend order 


### External pre-conditions

### Impact

A canceled offer can still be used rendering the offer cancellation and order deletion mechanisms broken and useless. 

This is pure speculation but the off-chain mechanisms might encounter issues when inactive lend orders successfully emit new events - for instance, when `acceptLendingOffer()` executes. 

### PoC

To visualize how this vulnerabilitiy works add the following test to `TwoLendersERC20Loan.t.sol` test file :
```solidity
    function test_canceledOfferUsedForMatching() public {
        // cancel existing lend offer
        LendOrder.cancelOffer();
        DLOImplementation.LendInfo memory lendInformation = LendOrder.getLendInfo();
        assertEq(lendInformation.perpetual, false);
        assertEq(lendInformation.availableAmount, 0);
        assertEq(LendOrder.isActive(), false);
        // adding funds to a NON-ACTIVE lend offer
        AEROContract.approve(address(LendOrder), 5e18);
        LendOrder.addFunds(5e18);
        lendInformation = LendOrder.getLendInfo();
        assertEq(lendInformation.availableAmount, 5e18);
     
        
        matchOffers();
    }
```
and run
```shell
forge test  --mt test_canceledOfferUsedForMatching -vvv
```
This test case cancels existing valid lend offer. Then adds back funds to it and successfully calls `matchOffers()` where a deleted order is used in a loan. 

### Mitigation

The simplest way to solve this issue is to set `isBorrowOrderLegit` and `isLendOrderLegit` to false when deleting an order AND make sure to add the following check to `addFunds()`, `cancelOffer()` (for both lender and borrow offers ), `acceptLendingOffer()` and `acceptBorrowOffer()` functions:
```solidity
require(isActive, "Offer is not active");
```
Note that this check still allows `addFunds()` to be called when `availableAmount` is zero if `perpetual` is `true` because in that case `isActive` cannot be set to `false`. 

Although I don't see any serious impact other than `BorrowOrderUpdated()` event emission caused by lack of such validation in the `updateBorrowOrder()` function, consider adding it there as well - `updateLendOrder()` is already checking whether the offer is active. 

If `isBorrowOrderLegit` and `isLendOrderLegit` are meant to exclusively check whether given order was created in a factory, `matchOffersV3()` needs to check `isActive` status of the used offers.
