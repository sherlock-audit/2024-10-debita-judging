# TaxTokensReceipts is not usable as collateral in the Auction contract

### Summary

The transferFrom(L-93) function in the TaxTokensReceipts will always revert when a user buy the NFT by calling the buyNFT function in an auction.

### Root Cause

The problem occur in this check of the trnasferFrom function :

```solidity
 function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public virtual override(ERC721, IERC721) {
        bool isReceiverAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(to) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(to) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(to);
        bool isSenderAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(from) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(from) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(from);
        // Debita not involved --> revert
        require(
            isReceiverAddressDebita || isSenderAddressDebita,
            "TaxTokensReceipts: Debita not involved"
        );
```
The problem occur because an auction is not a borrowOrder or a lendOrder or a loan so the call to buyNFT will always revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

1 A TaxTokensReceipts NFT must be used as an NFT in an auction.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1- A user took a loan with several lends.
2- The user missed the deadlline.
3- A lender call  createAuctionForCollateral.
4- but the NFT will never be bought because of the revert.
5- the NFT will be stuck forever in the auction contract.

### Impact

The TaxTokensReceipts is not usable with the Auction contract

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add in the function a check for the auctions like that : 

```solidity
    address public auctionFactory;

constructor(
        address _token,
        address _borrowOrderFactory,
        address _lendOrderFactory,
        address _aggregator,
       address _auctionFactory
    ) ERC721("TaxTokensReceipts", "TTR") {
        tokenAddress = _token;
        borrowOrderFactory = _borrowOrderFactory;
        lendOrderFactory = _lendOrderFactory;
        Aggregator = _aggregator;
       auctionFactory=_auctionFactory;
    }
 function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public virtual override(ERC721, IERC721) {
        bool isReceiverAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(to) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(to) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(to)|| IAuctionFactory(auctionFactory).isAuction(to);
        bool isSenderAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(from) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(from) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(from) || IAuctionFactory(auctionFactory).isAuction(from);
        // Debita not involved --> revert
        require(
            isReceiverAddressDebita || isSenderAddressDebita,
            "TaxTokensReceipts: Debita not involved"
        );
```
