# Using approval() instead of safeApproval() disallows borrower from extending Loans with 0 APR.




### Summary

The borrower cannot extend his loan duration if his order is matched with atleast one perpetual `lendOrder` with `0` APR.

### Root Cause

>Some tokens (e.g. BNB) revert when approving a zero value amount (i.e. a call to approve(address, 0)).

In `extendLoan()`, 
    The function is calling `IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer),amount)`  continued with `lendOffer.addFunds()`. This allows `lendOrder` contract to transfer the approved amount from `Loan` contract to itself.

[CODE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L233-L236)
```solidity
    if (
        lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer
    ) {
        IERC20(offer.principle).approve( //@audit safeApprve
            address(lendOffer),
            interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita
        );
        lendOffer.addFunds(
            interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita
        );
    }
```
But,
If an offer has mentioned its `APR = 0`, the `interestOfUsedTime` of that offer will always be `0` , and the same goes to `interestToPayToDebita` since it is `interestOfUsedTime * feeLender`

As a result, protocol will try to `approve` with `0` amount , which will result to reverting in some weird tokns like BNB.

Since while extending the for loop iterates through the entire `acceptedOffers`, the borrower cannot only  save the `currentOffer` but also the remaining `offers` from being `liquidate`.

### Internal pre-conditions
One of the offers a borrowOrder is matched with is perpetual LendOrder whose principle asset is BNB.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Borrower cannot  call `extendLoans()` to save their collateral , if his order got matched with atleast one perpetual `LendOrder` with `0` APR ahich has a principle asset a `weird token` which reverts on `0` approval. 

An attacker can easily make use of this vulnerability, by matching the `borrowOrder` with one such `lendOrder`.

### PoC
_No response_

### Mitigation

use forceApproval instead.
