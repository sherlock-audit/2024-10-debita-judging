# Owner can never be changed due to self-assignment bugin auctionFactoryDebita and orderFactory

### Summary

Both buyOrderFactory.sol and auctionFactoryDebita.sol contracts contain an identical critical bug where the owner address is being assigned to itself (`owner = owner`) instead of being updated to the new address. This makes the ownership transfer functionality completely broken in both contracts, as the owner will always remain unchanged regardless of the input.


### Root Cause

In both contracts, the assignment statement `owner = owner` is a self-assignment that has no effect - it's simply assigning the state variable to itself rather than updating it with the new owner address parameter.

**buyOrderFactory.sol:**
```solidity
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner;  // BUG: Self-assignment, owner never changes
}
```

**auctionFactoryDebita.sol (same issue):**
```solidity
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner;  // BUG: Same self-assignment bug
}
```


### Internal pre-conditions

owner 

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Current owner calls `changeOwner(address newOwner)` with a new address
2. Ownership checks pass
3. `owner = owner` executes, but merely assigns the current owner address to itself
4. Contract owner remains unchanged, making ownership transfer impossible

### Impact

Both contracts suffer from permanently locked ownership, which:

- Makes owner addresses permanent after deployment
- Prevents recovery if owner keys are compromised
- Blocks transfer to new management structures
- Makes it impossible to correct incorrectly set owner addresses
- Could lead to permanently locked contract functionality if owner access is required for critical functions

### PoC

Paset this code in `BuyOrder.t.sol`

```solidity
   function testChangeOwnerShadowing() public {
        address newOwner = address(0x03);

        // Attempt to change owner on behalf of anyone
        vm.startPrank(newOwner);
        factory.changeOwner(newOwner);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Log the owner after the failed attempt
        console.log("Owner after failed change attempt:", factory.owner());
    }
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = _newOwner;  // Actually update the owner
}
```
