# Collateral Validation Logic in matchOffersV3 Function

### Summary

In `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol` the `matchOffersV3` function, there's a requirement that checks whether the collateral provided is valid based on certain conditions. This condition erroneously uses !borrowInfo.isNFT (the logical NOT of borrowInfo.isNFT). The correct logic should use borrowInfo.isNFT without the logical NOT operator. This issue affects the acceptance of collateral, potentially allowing invalid or unverified assets and rejecting valid ones, which can lead to security vulnerabilities and operational problems within the protocol.


### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:299-303](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L299-L303) the `require` line has wrong logic: `!borrowInfo.isNFT`. The logic should be `borrowInfo.isNFT` because we are accepting NFTs.

### Impact

- **Unintended Acceptance of Non-NFT Collateral**: Non-NFT collateral is accepted even if it is not a valid receipt. This could allow unverified or malicious ERC20 tokens to be used as collateral, posing a risk to the protocol.

- **Rejection of Valid NFT Collateral**: NFTs that are not listed as valid receipts are rejected, even though the protocol intends to accept any NFT as collateral. This limits the range of acceptable NFTs and may prevent users from leveraging legitimate assets.
