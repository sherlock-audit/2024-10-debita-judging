# The borrower pays duplicate interest for overlapping periods.

### Summary

The borrower pays duplicate interest for overlapping periods.

### Root Cause

When the borrower calls **DebitaV3Loan.extendLoan**, interest is settled once, with the time period being **`block.timestamp - loanData.startedAt;`**. However, when the borrower repays the loan by calling **payDebt**, interest is calculated again, using **`block.timestamp - loanData.startedAt;`**. Since **loanData.startedAt** is not updated within the **DebitaV3Loan.extendLoan** function, the borrower ends up paying duplicate interest for the same period, resulting in a loss of the borrower's assets. Additionally, the code section in the **extendLoan()** function [this part of the code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L588-L592C37) does not serve any purpose.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.The borrower needs to call extendLoan.
2.The borrower needs to repay the loan on time.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path


```solidity
//borrower
extendLoan()
-------->call calculateInterestToPay()
payDebt()
-------->call calculateInterestToPay()
```



### Impact

The borrower pays duplicate interest, causing a loss of assets.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Update **loanData.startedAt** in the **extendLoan()** function, or add a new variable in **loanData** to record the interest calculation start time.
