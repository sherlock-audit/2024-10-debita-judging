# Missing safeguards in `transferOwnership` function

### Summary

The `transferOwnership` function in the contract fails to follow best practices for transferring ownership. While it utilizes the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to the current owner, the function lacks several safeguards:

1. **No Zero Address Check**: The ownership can be transferred to the zero address, potentially making the contract unmanageable.
2. **No Two-Step Ownership Transfer**: The current implementation allows the owner to immediately transfer ownership without confirmation or explicit acceptance by the new owner.
3. **No Event Emission**: The function does not emit an event to log the ownership transfer, which can hinder auditability and transparency.

### Impact

The lack of two-step ownership transfer and other safeguards can lead to unauthorized access, accidental transfers, and difficulties in auditing ownership changes.

### Tool used
Manual Review

### Mitigation

To mitigate these issues, the following changes are recommended:

1. **Zero Address Check:**
Ensure that the new owner's address is not the zero address.

2. **Two-Step Ownership Transfer**:
Implement a two-step process where the current owner sets a pendingOwner, and the new owner must accept the ownership.

3. **Event Emission:**
Emit an OwnershipTransferred event when the ownership changes to improve auditability.

```solidity
address public pendingOwner;
event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);

function transferOwnership(address _newAddress) public onlyOwner {
    require(_newAddress != address(0), "New owner cannot be the zero address");
    pendingOwner = _newAddress;
}

function acceptOwnership() public {
    require(msg.sender == pendingOwner, "Caller is not the pending owner");
    emit OwnershipTransferred(admin, pendingOwner);
    admin = pendingOwner;
    pendingOwner = address(0);
}

```
