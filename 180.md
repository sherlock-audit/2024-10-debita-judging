# Delete Order will set wrong index. Causing undefined behaviour

### Summary


In `BorrowOrderFactory` and `AuctionFactory.sol`,
Delete latest Order not only remove order, but also update Order with `address(0)` to different index.

This did not yet break core function but have uncertainty of undefined logic behaviour. Order with zero address is never used but its index value keep changing due to logic error.


### Root Cause


In delete buy order both `BuyOrderFactory.sol` and `AuctionFactory.sol`.

```solidity
    function _deleteAuctionOrder(address _AuctionOrder) external onlyAuctions {
        // get index of the Auction order
        uint index = AuctionOrderIndex[_AuctionOrder];
        AuctionOrderIndex[_AuctionOrder] = 0;

        // get last Auction order
        allActiveAuctionOrders[index] = allActiveAuctionOrders[
            activeOrdersCount - 1
        ];
        // take out last Auction order
        allActiveAuctionOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

        // switch index of the last Auction order to the deleted Auction order
        AuctionOrderIndex[allActiveAuctionOrders[index]] = index;
        activeOrdersCount--;
    }
```

This variable `allActiveAuctionOrders[index]` suppose to be "swapped" order before switching index
If delete last array Order, there is no need to swap.
Then take out last Auction order already reset last array value
`allActiveAuctionOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);`
But switch index still happen, `AuctionOrderIndex[allActiveAuctionOrders[index]] = index;`
And it set address(0) to different index. Which is no different than
`AuctionOrderIndex[allActiveAuctionOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]] = AuctionOrderIndex[address(0)] = index`

### Internal pre-conditions


Example: We have array `allActiveAuctionOrders` of 5 elements

`[ address(1), address(5), address(3), address(2), address(4) ]`

And `AuctionOrderIndex[address(4)] = 4`


### External pre-conditions

Removing last element which is address(4). And we get:
`[ address(1), address(5), address(3), address(2)]`

- `AuctionOrderIndex[address(4)] = 0`
- `AuctionOrderIndex[address(0)] = 4`

`address(0)` is never used

### Attack Path

This happen everytime any user create new order and then cancel order right after.

### Impact

Undefined logic behaviour. Function say delete order and swap index does not work with order just happen tobe the order in the last array of active order.
