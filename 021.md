Large Orchid Seal

Medium

# There is a lack of verification for the update time of the oracle data.

## Summary
There is a lack of verification for the update time of the oracle data.
## Vulnerability Details
When obtaining the latest price through Chainlink, there is no check on the validity of the updateAt parameter, which may result in obtaining an invalid price.
contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol
```javascript
     (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```
Chainlink API:
```javascript
  function latestRoundData(
    address base,
    address quote
  ) external view returns (uint80 roundId, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound);
```
As you can see the updatedAt timestamp is not checked. So the price may be outdated.
## Impact
Could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage as price is not updated.

## Recommendation
Add check like this: if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - LIMIT) revert PriceOutdated();
