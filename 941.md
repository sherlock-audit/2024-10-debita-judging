# Lack of upgradeability in factories and aggregator contracts and improper initialization of instance in `createBorrowOrder`

### Summary

Factories and aggregator contracts rely on proxies for deploying `borrow`, `lend`, `buyOrder `and `loan` instances. However, the implementation contracts cannot be upgraded, defeating the primary purpose of this setup. 

**The sponsor has confirmed in private thread that this is an issue for the protocol.**

Additionally, in the `createBorrowOrder function, the `DBOImplementation` is directly instantiated without using a proxy, which does not follow the consistent architectural design of the protocol.

### Root Cause

The factories and aggregator contracts do not provide a mechanism to update the implementation contracts. This means any future improvements or fixes **on the implementation** require deploying all new factories which is against the protocol's factories setup purpose of managing any upgrade directly from the factory.
Here is the list of the instances where this is an issue:
- [DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L53)
- [DebitaLendOfferFactory](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L99)
- [DebitaV3Aggregator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L232)
- [buyOrderFactory](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L58)

In the `createBorrowOrder` function of `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory`, the `DBOImplementation` is directly instantiated directly [without using the proxy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L106).

### Impact

The lack of upgradeability in factories and aggregator contracts will result in the protocol being unable to freely upgrade the implementations and needing to redeploy most contracts again. 
The upgrade functionality in the factories which is expected by users, is not working as expected.

### Mitigation

- Add a function in the factories and aggregator contracts to update the implementationContract address:
```js
function updateImplementation(address newImplementation) external onlyOwner{
    implementationContract = newImplementation;
}
```
- Replace the direct instantiation of `DBOImplementation` in `createBorrowOrder` with the proxy pattern:
```js
DebitaProxyContract proxy = new DebitaProxyContract(implementationContract);
DBOImplementation borrowOffer = DBOImplementation(address(proxy));
```
