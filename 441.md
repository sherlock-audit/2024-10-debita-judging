# Possible `DoS` at `claimBribesMultiple`

## Summary

When performing a function `claimBribesMultiple`, this function has three nested looping that possible to DoS block gas limit.

## Vulnerability details

At the function `claimBribesMultiple`, there is a lot of looping, possible to cause a block gas limit. There are three looping associated. First looping at :

Afterthat, second looping and third at : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/veNFTAerodrome.sol#L151-L172

In this code also perfoming transfer token that use a lot of gas cost. Assume (worst case) that transfer token and smart contract interaction use `100,000` gas units. We know that max block gas limit is `30 milion` gas units.  So, the max interaction is `30_000_000` / `100_000` = `300` iterations. If we perform with three nested loop `(n**3)`, the possible maximum `n` is `7(7**3 = 343)`. In conclusion, we only can use length of each array  `address[] calldata vaults, address[] calldata _bribes, address[][] calldata _tokens` not more than `7`.

## Recomendation

To avoid this issue, please add more input validation for array length to avoid block gas limit.
