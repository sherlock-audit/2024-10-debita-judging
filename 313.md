# Legitimate Lenders and Borrowers Will Not Be Incentivized.

### Summary

The `DebitaIncentives::updateFunds()` function contains a logical error that prevents legitimate lenders and borrowers from being incentivized.

### Root Cause

- The arises from the [DebitaIncentives::updateFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L317) function:
```solidity
    function updateFunds(
        infoOfOffers[] memory informationOffers,
        address collateral,
        address[] memory lenders,
        address borrower
    ) public onlyAggregator {
        for (uint i = 0; i < lenders.length; i++) {
            bool validPair = isPairWhitelisted[informationOffers[i].principle][
                collateral
            ];
            if (!validPair) {
@>              return;
            }
            ------ SKIP ------
        }
    }
```
If the `i`th pair is not whitelisted, the function returns immediately, skipping updates for the subsequent pairs even if they are valid.


### Internal pre-conditions

- There are whitelisted pairs, e.g: USDC/WBTC.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Assume that two lend offers match with a borrow offer.
    1. The the first lender's principal is `USDC` and the second lender's principal is `USDT`.
    2. The borrower's collateral is `WBTC`.
2. Suppose the `USDC/WBTC` pair is not whitelisted, but `USDT/WBTC` pair is whitelisted.
3. When `updateFunds()` processes the first pair (index `0`), it encounters a non whitelisted pair `USDC/WBTC` and returns immediately.
4. Consequently, the valid `USDT/WBTC` pair is not updated, and the second lender and the borrower lose incentives.


### Impact

Loss of funds because lenders and borrowers lose incentives.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to replace the `return` statement with the `continue` to ensure the loop processes all pairs:
```diff
            if (!validPair) {
-               return;
+               continue;
            }
```
This change ensures that the function skips invalid pairs but processes valid ones, updating the incentives correctly.
