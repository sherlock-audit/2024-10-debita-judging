# Used `transfer()` instead of `safeTransfer`

## Summary

In the `DebitaIncentives::claimIncentives() ` , `transfer()` function is used with the IERC20 interfaces to interact with tokens. However, the interface expects the transfer function to have a return value on success. It is important to note that the transfer functions of some
tokens (e.g., USDT) do not return any values.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

`transfer()` might return false instead of reverting, in this case, ignoring return value leads to considering it successful.

## Code Snippet

[`DebitaIncentives::claimIncentives()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L142-L214)

```solidity
    function claimIncentives(
        address[] memory principles,
        address[][] memory tokensIncentives,
        uint epoch
    ) public {
               ...
               ...
               ...
        @>>        IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amountToClaim);
               ...
               ...
                );
            }
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the `SafeERC20` library implementation from OpenZeppelin and call `safeTransfer`
