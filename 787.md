# State Variable Shadowing in `changeOwner()` Function

### Summary

The `changeOwner()` function in multiple contract fails to properly update the global `owner` state variable due to a shadowing issue caused by a function parameter with the same name. This results in the ownership change mechanism being non-functional.

Code Affected:
[DebitaV3Aggregator.sol::changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682)
[AuctionFactory.sol::changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218)
[BuyOrderFactory.sol::changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186)

### Root Cause

The function argument `owner` shadows the state variable `owner`. The assignment `owner = owner` operates on the function argument in the local scope rather than the global state variable. As a result, the global `owner` remains unchanged. Either way due to `require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");` this will always revert unless `owner` is the `msg.sender`.

### Impact

The bug does not allow the ownership of the contract to be updated, effectively rendering the `changeOwner()` function useless.

### PoC

This PoC applies for the other instances as well, as it's the same code:
```solidity
    function test_changeOwner() public {
      vm.warp(block.timestamp + 7 hours);
     // @audit This will always revert with Only owner
      DebitaV3AggregatorContract.changeOwner(address(0xdead));
```

### Mitigation

To fix the issue, avoid using the same name for the function parameter and the state variable. Update the function to properly assign the new value to the global owner state variable:

```solidity
function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = newOwner; // Correctly updates the global owner
}
```
