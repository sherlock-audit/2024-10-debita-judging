# Uninitialized initialized Variable in Ownerships Contract

### Summary

The Ownerships contract includes a private bool variable named initialized. However, this variable is never explicitly set within the contract's logic, leaving it with its default value of false. As a result, any logic or condition depending on the initialized variable will fail to function as intended, potentially leading to unexpected contract behavior or vulnerabilities.

### Root Cause

The initialized variable is defined but not assigned a value or updated within the contract, leading it to remain in its default state (false).

The absence of initialization logic suggests incomplete or overlooked implementation of functionality related to contract setup or lifecycle management.

Logic Failure: Functions or modifiers dependent on initialized will behave incorrectly, potentially breaking contract functionality.

there should be a place in the contract where the "initialized" variable is set
