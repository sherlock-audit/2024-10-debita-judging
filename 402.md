# Malicious user can create multiple lend orders with zero lending amounts, disrupting protocol efficiency

### Summary

The lack of validation for zero lending amounts in the `createLendOrder` function will disrupt the protocol's efficiency, as empty lend orders will be created. This will negatively impact the order-matching process, causing unnecessary computational overhead for the protocol. Additionally, the connector (whether a bot or another participant) may lose fees while attempting to match these empty lend orders.

### Root Cause

In [`DLOFactory::createLendOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L124), the `_startedLendingAmount` parameter is not validated for a non-zero value before proceeding with the transaction. This allows empty lend orders to be created, which can bloat the system and degrade its performance when attempting to match orders.



### Internal pre-conditions

1. An attacker or user needs to call `createLendOrder()` with `_startedLendingAmount` set to 0.
2. The lendOfferProxy contract will still be deployed despite the zero value, leading to an empty order.
3. The protocol processes these transactions without reverting, storing the empty orders in its active list.

### External pre-conditions

1. The chain allows transactions with zero-value transfers (this is common for chains like Sonic, Base, Arbitrum, and OP).
2. The gas price must be low enough for the attack to be feasible without excessive cost.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls `createLendOrder()` with `_startedLendingAmount` set to `0` multiple times.
2. `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom()` is invoked, but no funds are transferred due to the zero value.
3. The empty lend order is created and stored in the system, consuming unnecessary resources.
4. The connector (bot or user) attempts to match offers, wasting resources and possibly losing fees by matching empty lend orders.

### Impact

The protocolâ€™s efficiency is disrupted as empty lend orders clog the order-matching process, leading to wasted gas fees. The connector, which is responsible for matching orders, will lose fees trying to match these empty offers, resulting in financial losses and operational inefficiencies. The attacker does not directly profit but burdens the protocol with inefficiencies.

### PoC

Add this test to `test/local/Loan/MultiplePrinciples.t.sol`
```solidity
function testCreateZeroAmountLendOrder() public {
        for (uint i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            vm.startPrank(secondLender);
            wETHContract.approve(address(DLOFactoryContract), 5e18);
            uint[] memory ratioLenders = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
            ratioLenders[0] = 4e17;

            DLOFactoryContract.createLendOrder(
                false,
                allDynamicData.getDynamicBoolArray(1),
                false,
                allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1),
                1000,
                9640000,
                86400,
                allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1),
                wETH,
                allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1),
                ratioLenders,
                address(0x0), 
                0 // here is `the _startedLendingAmount = 0`
            );

            console.log(
                "order",
                i,
                "has adress : ",
                DLOFactoryContract.allActiveLendOrders(i)
            );
            vm.stopPrank();
        }
    }
```

The result is this 

```shell
$ forge test --mt testCreateZeroAmountLendOrder -v

### Mitigation

The mitigation for this issue involves implementing a validation check in the [ `createLendOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L124)  function to ensure that the `_startedLendingAmount` is greater than `zero `before processing the transaction.

```diff 
+ require(_startedLendingAmount > 0, "Lending amount must be greater than zero");
```
