# Mistaken Variable Overwrite in changeOwner Function Prevents Ownership Change

### Summary

The changeOwner function erroneously uses the owner state variable as both the function parameter and the assignment target, leading to a logical flaw. This mistake prevents the owner from being updated as intended. As a result, ownership transfer functionality is entirely broken, leaving the contract stuck with its initially assigned owner.



### Root Cause

The use of owner as both the name of the function parameter and the state variable. This causes the assignment owner = owner to always refer to the function parameter, which effectively has no effect on the owner state variable.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The ownership of the contract cannot be transferred after deployment as the function responsible for changing owner is not effective

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

update the DebitaV3Aggregator.sol::changeOwner() to 

```diff
 -   function changeOwner(address owner) public {
 +       function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
-        owner = owner;
+        owner = _owner;
    }
```
