# Create methods are suspicious of the reorg attack

## summary
The createAuction() function deploys a new dutchAuction contract using the `create`, where the address derivation depends only on the AuctionFactory nonce.

## vulnerability details
Re-orgs can happen in all EVM chains and as confirmed the contracts will be deployed on most EVM compatible L2s including Arbitrum, etc. In ethereum, where this is deployed, Re-orgs has already been happened.

This issue will increase as some of the chains like Arbitrum and Polygon are suspicious of the reorg attacks.

The issue would happen when users rely on the address derivation in advance or try to deploy the position clone with the same address on different EVM chains, any `veNFT` sent to the `new` contract could potentially be assigned to anyone else. All in all, it could lead to the theft of user funds.

```solidity
function createAuction(
        uint _veNFTID,
        address _veNFTAddress,
        address liquidationToken,
        uint _initAmount,
        uint _floorAmount,
        uint _duration
    ) public returns (address) {
        ...snip...

    @>    DutchAuction_veNFT _createdAuction = new DutchAuction_veNFT(
            _veNFTID,
            _veNFTAddress,
            liquidationToken,
            msg.sender,
            _initAmount,
            _floorAmount,
            _duration,
            IAggregator(aggregator).isSenderALoan(msg.sender) // if the sender is a loan --> isLiquidation = true
        );

        // Transfer veNFT
        IERC721(_veNFTAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(_createdAuction),
            _veNFTID,
            ""
        );

        ...Snip...
    }
```
Optimistic rollups (Optimism/Arbitrum) are also suspect to reorgs since if someone finds a fraud the blocks will be reverted, even though the user receives a confirmation.

## Recommendation
Deploy such contracts via `create2` with `salt` that includes `msg.sender`
