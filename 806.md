# Missing perpetual check will prevent borrowers from accepting perpetual lend offers

### Summary

The missing check for the `perpetual` status in the duration validation will cause borrowers to be unable to accept perpetual lend offers, as the system incorrectly enforces duration limits on perpetual lend orders.



### Root Cause

In 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L432-L436
, the duration validation does not consider whether the lend order is perpetual. Specifically, the require statement fails to include a check for `!lendInfo.perpetual`, leading to incorrect validation for perpetual lend orders:

```solidity
require(
    borrowInfo.duration >= lendInfo.minDuration &&
    borrowInfo.duration <= lendInfo.maxDuration,
    "Invalid duration"
);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The lend order has lendInfo.perpetual set to true.
2. A borrower attempts to accept the perpetual lend order.
3. The borrowInfo.duration does not satisfy lendInfo.minDuration and lendInfo.maxDuration constraints.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Borrower calls the function to accept a lend order with lendInfo.perpetual set to true.
2. The system performs a duration check without considering the perpetual status:
```solidity
require(
    borrowInfo.duration >= lendInfo.minDuration &&
    borrowInfo.duration <= lendInfo.maxDuration,
    "Invalid duration"
);
```
3. Since the borrower's duration may not meet the constraints (e.g., could be zero or not within the specified range), the require statement fails.
4. The transaction reverts with an "Invalid duration" error, preventing the borrower from accepting the perpetual lend offer.


### Impact

The borrowers cannot accept perpetual lend offers due to the incorrect duration validation, effectively disabling the perpetual lending functionality for borrowers.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the duration validation to account for perpetual lend orders by adding a check for `!lendInfo.perpetual`:
```solidity
require(
    (!lendInfo.perpetual && 
        borrowInfo.duration >= lendInfo.minDuration &&
        borrowInfo.duration <= lendInfo.maxDuration) || 
    lendInfo.perpetual,
    "Invalid duration"
);
```
