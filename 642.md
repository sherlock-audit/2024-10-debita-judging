# Changing ownership of DebitaV3Aggregator, buyOrderFactory, auctionFactoryDebita contracts do not work.

### Summary
[DebitaV3Aggregator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682), [auctionFactoryDebita](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218), [buyOrderFactory](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186) all 3 contracts have the same `changeOwner` function. This function has a `owner` parameter which shadows an existing state variable. That's why even when called by the correct owner and a valid parameter the owner of the contracts do not change. 

### Root Cause

The `changeOwner` function of [DebitaV3Aggregator.changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682), [auctionFactoryDebita.changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218) and [buyOrderFactory..changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186) is as follows:

```solidity
// change owner of the contract only between 0 and 6 hours after deployment
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
}
```
The parameter `owner` shadows an existing state variable `owner`. When invoked it compares `msg.sender` with parameter `owner` instead of the state variable. 

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path

1. Call `changeOwner` with a new owner address from a valid owner account. The call will revert, even though it shouldn't. 
2. Now call `changeOwner` from an invalid owner account. Pass a same address as `msg.sender`. The call won't revert, even though it should. 
3. In the both above scenarios the contract owner remains unchanged. 

### Impact

The protocol designers expect the contract deployer to transfer the contract ownership to a new address within 6 hours of contract deployment. But contract ownership transfer will never be possible. 

### PoC

Add the following code to `BasicDebitaAggregator.t.sol`.

```solidity
// PoC test code
function testChangeOwnership() public {
        address newOwner = vm.addr(1);
        assertEq(DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner(), address(this)); // after deployment deployer is the contract owner

        vm.expectRevert(bytes('Only owner'));
        DebitaV3AggregatorContract.changeOwner(newOwner);   // will revert even though caller is the current owner.

        vm.prank(newOwner);
        DebitaV3AggregatorContract.changeOwner(newOwner);   // won't revert if the caller and the newOwner are same address but won't chnage the owner address.
        assertNotEq(DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner(), newOwner); // contract owner address did not change after calling changeOwner.
        assertEq(DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner(), address(this)); // contract owner is still the deployer address.
}
```

### Mitigation

Change the `changeOwner` code as follows:
```solidity
function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");

        owner = _owner;
}
```
