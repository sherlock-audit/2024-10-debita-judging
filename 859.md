# Risks of Uninitialized DebitaContract in Ownerships Contract

### Summary

The Ownerships contract has a critical issue: the DebitaContract address is not initialized in the constructor or at the time of deployment. It retains its default value of address(0) until explicitly set via the setDebitaContract function. This oversight can introduce several vulnerabilities and operational risks.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol#L17

- The DebitaContract address defaults to address(0) (zero address) until it is explicitly set using the setDebitaContract function.
- The setDebitaContract function can only be called once due to the onlyOwner modifier coupled with the ! initialized check. However, until the function is called, the contract operates with an invalid DebitaContract address.

### Impact

This could potentially lead to 
**Unauthorized minting via mint function:**

- The mint function relies on the onlyContract modifier, which checks that msg.sender equals DebitaContract.
- If DebitaContract is address(0), any call with msg.sender == address(0) (which could occur due to contract calls or inadvertent issues) would bypass this check, leading to unauthorized minting.

**Unrestricted Burning via burn Function:**

- The burn function calls IDebitaAggregator(DebitaContract).isSenderALoan(msg.sender) to validate the caller.
- With DebitaContract == address(0), this results in a call to a nonexistent contract, which will revert every time. Thus, burning functionality becomes inoperable until DebitaContract is correctly set.

**Operational Delays:**

If the DebitaContract address is not set promptly, critical functionalities such as minting and burning cannot be used, potentially halting operations dependent on this contract.

**Exploitation of Timing Gaps**

There is a timing gap between contract deployment and setDebitaContract execution. During this period:
- The onlyContract modifier effectively blocks all minting.
- However, attackers or malicious actors could exploit other vulnerabilities or assumptions made based on the contract's functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Initialize DebitaContract in Constructor or Deployment Script
- Add Validity Checks in against default address
