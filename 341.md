# DoS on `extendLoan()` Due to an Underflow

### Summary

In the `DebitaV3Loan.sol::extendLoan()` function, bounding the new protocol fee to the minimum value can result in an underflow.

When creating a loan, the default duration is the one specified by the borrower. If the borrower decides to extend the loan, the duration is extended to the `maxDuration` of each accepted lend offer, with each offer having its own individual deadline.

Within the `extendLoan()` function, the protocol calculates the fee (0.04% per day) based only on the extended duration of each offer, as the initial duration fee was already deducted when the offers were matched. After computing the fee for the `maxDuration` of each lend offer, it is bounded between the maximum and minimum permissible values (0.2% - 0.8%). 

The issue arises when the fee is incorrectly bounded to the minimum value. Instead of being set to 0.2%, it is bounded to the `feePerDay` value (0.04%), which can cause an underflow when calculating the `missingBorrowFee` value in the subsequent line:

```solidity
        function extendLoan() public {
            
        // Function code ...

            for (uint i; i < m_loan._acceptedOffers.length; i++) {
                
                // Function code ...

                uint misingBorrowFee;

                // if user already paid the max fee, then we dont have to charge them again
                if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
                    
                    uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /
                        86400);
                    if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
                        feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
>>                  } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) {
>>                      feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
                    }

>>                  misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
                }
                uint principleAmount = offer.principleAmount;
                uint feeAmount = (principleAmount * misingBorrowFee) / 10000;

                // Function code ...
            }
        }
```


### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Loan.sol:606](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L606), an incorrect minimum bounding value is used.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Short loan duration such that the `protocol fee == 0.2%`.
- Loan extension.
- The difference between the borrower's `duration` and the lender's `maxDuration` should be small, resulting in a protocol fee between `0.04%` and `0.2%`.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

#### Lend Offer by Alice:
- **Available Amount**: 1000 USDC  
- **Max Duration**: 4 days  
- **Collateral Accepted**: WETH  

#### Borrow Offer by Bob:
- **Available Amount**: 1 WETH  
- **Duration**: 3 days  
- **Principle Accepted**: USDC  

#### Order Matching:
- **Duration of the Loan**: 3 days (`259,200 seconds`)    
- **Percentage Fee**: 0.12% < minFee (`(3 days * 0.04%)/86400`)
- **Bounded Percentage Fee**: minFee = 0.2%
- **Fee to Pay**: 2 USDC (`Percentage Fee * Amount Lent`)  

---

#### **Expected Fee Calculation**  
**When the loan is extended**:  
- **New Duration of the Loan**: 4 days  
- **Percentage Fee Paid**: 0.2%  
- **New Total Percentage**: 0.16% < minFee (`(4 days * 0.04%)/86400`)
- **Bounded Percentage Fee**: minFee = 0.2%
- **Percentage to Pay**: 0.2% - 0.2% = 0 (`New Total Percentage - Percentage Fee Paid`)  
- **Fee to Pay**: 0 USDC (`Percentage to Pay * Amount Lent`)  

---

#### **Actual Fee Calculation**  

**When the loan is extended**:  
- **New Duration of the Loan**: 4 days  
- **Percentage Fee Paid**: 0.2%  
- **New Total Percentage**: 0.16% > feePerDay (`(4 days * 0.04%)/86400`) 
- **Percentage to Pay**: 0.16% - 0.2% = underflow (`New Total Percentage - Percentage Fee Paid`) 

### Impact

- Underflow on [DebitaV3Loan.sol:610](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L610) because the `PorcentageOfFeePaid` can be greater than `feeOfMaxDeadline`.
- DoS on `extendLoan()`

### Mitigation

Use the `minFee` value instead of `feePerDay`, that way `PorcentageOfFeePaid` will never be greater than `feeOfMaxDeadline`:

```diff
        function extendLoan() public {
            
        // Function code ...

            for (uint i; i < m_loan._acceptedOffers.length; i++) {
                
                // Function code ...

                uint misingBorrowFee;

                // if user already paid the max fee, then we dont have to charge them again
                if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
                    
                    uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /
                        86400);
                    if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
                        feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
-                   } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) {
-                       feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
+                   } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < minFEE) {
+                       feeOfMaxDeadline = minFEE;
                    }

                    misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
                }
                uint principleAmount = offer.principleAmount;
                uint feeAmount = (principleAmount * misingBorrowFee) / 10000;

                // Function code ...
            }
        }
```
