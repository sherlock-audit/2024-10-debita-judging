# Borrowers can pay 0 interest for high value tokens

### Summary

The [interest calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L734) in `calculateInterestToPay` may be round down to 0. This will cause that borrowers do not need to pay any interest for this loan.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Loan:calculateInterestToPay](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L721), we will calculate the debt for each lend order.
The problem is that the `interest` may be round down to 0, especially for high value, low decimal tokne(eg, WBTC). And borrowers do not need to pay any interest for this lend order.
For example:
- Principle: WBTC
- principle amount for one lend order: 1.5e4 (WBTC's decimal is 8. So 1.5e4 amount's actual value is around 100,000/10,000 * 1.5 = 15 dollar. Assume BTC's price is 100,000)
- apr = 200 (2%)
- Initial borrow duration is 10 days.
- Borrower Alice pays the debt in day 1, active time is 86400.

The `uint anualInterest = (offer.principleAmount * offer.apr) / 10000 = 1.5e4 * 200/1e4 = 300`
The `uint interest = (anualInterest * activeTime) / 31536000 = 300 * 86400/31536000 = 0`
Considering that we can match one borrow order with maximum 29 lend orders, the borrowers can borrow (29 * 15) dollar in one transaction and do not need to pay debt.
```solidity
    function calculateInterestToPay(uint index) public view returns (uint) {
        infoOfOffers memory offer = loanData._acceptedOffers[index];
        uint anualInterest = (offer.principleAmount * offer.apr) / 10000;
        // check already duration
        uint activeTime = block.timestamp - loanData.startedAt;
        ...
        uint interest = (anualInterest * activeTime) / 31536000;
        // subtract already paid interest
        return interest - offer.interestPaid;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

- Alice creates one borrow order to borrow WBTC, apr = 200
- Bob creates one lend order to lend WBTC, apr = 200, min duration = 10 days, max duration = 30 days.
- Alice matches her borrow order and bob's lend order. In this match, alice splits the lend order to let each lend order's principle amount equal 1.5e4. Alice can match 29 small lend orders in this match. 
- Alice pays the debt when the time passed one day. And the interest is zero.

### Impact

Borrowers can repeatedly borrow minor amount WBTC and pay 0 interest.

### PoC

Simplify the function calculateInterestToPay with assigned parameters. The returned interest is 0.
```solidity
    function interestPoc() external pure returns (uint256){
        uint apr = 200;
        uint principleAmount = 1.5e4;
        uint anualInterest = (principleAmount * apr) / 10000;
        // check already duration
        uint activeTime = 86400; // 1 day

        uint interest = (anualInterest * activeTime) / 31536000;
        // subtract already paid interest
        return interest;
    }
```

### Mitigation

Round up in `interest`'s calculation. And we should add one option minimum principle amount for borrow order and lend order. This can prevent that the principle amount is splited into small pieces for each order.
