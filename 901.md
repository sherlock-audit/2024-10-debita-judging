# wrong values for tokens can be used

### Summary

pyth and chainlink oracles return already scaled price in 8 decimals the aggregator contract than multiplies this scaled value with  10 ** 8 later it normalizes it but it does not normalize the already scaled oracle price leading to a wrong inflated value of tokens

### Root Cause

the root cause is that the code does not account the scaled value returned by the oracle

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The price returned from the contract will be inflated. As a result, the value of collateral will be overinflated
this inflated value is then used throughout the contract to calculate values related to loan

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

normalize/account for  the price returned by oracle
