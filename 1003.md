# DebitaChainlink.getPrice returns incorrect price during flash crashes

### Summary

Chainlink price feeds have in-built minimum & maximum prices they will return; if during a flash crash, bridge compromise, or depegging event, an asset’s value falls below the price feed’s minimum price, the oracle price feed will continue to report the (now incorrect) minimum price. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L30
```solidity
    function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```
Note there is only a check for price to be non-negative, and not within an acceptable range.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The wrong price may be returned in the event of a market crash. An adversary will then be able to borrow against the wrong price and incur bad debt to the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
require(price >= minPrice && price <= maxPrice, "invalid price");
```
