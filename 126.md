# Borrowers cannot pay debt when block.timestamp == offer.maxDeadline

### Summary

Borrowers cannot pay debt when block.timestamp == offer.maxDeadline. Borrowers will fail to pay debt to get back his collateral.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaLoan:payDebt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L186), borrowers can pay debt for this loan. When the block.timestamp <= nextDeadline(), borrowers can pay debt.
When block.timestamp > nextDeadline(), borrowers cannot pay debt and lender owners can start one auction for this collateral.
Based on current code implementation, it's clear that when block.timestamp == nextDeadline(), borrowers should be allowed to pay their debt.
The problem is that in payDebt() function, there is one time check **`require(offer.maxDeadline > block.timestamp, "Deadline passed");`**. When the block.timestamp == offer.maxDeadline, borrowers cannot pay the debt. But it's quite possible that `nextDeadline() == offer.maxDeadline`, especially when borrowers extend their loan.
```solidity
    function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
        IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);
        require(
            ownershipContract.ownerOf(loanData.borrowerID) == msg.sender,
            "Not borrower"
        );
        require(
            nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp,
            "Deadline passed to pay Debt"
        );
```
```solidity
    function createAuctionForCollateral(
        uint indexOfLender
    ) external nonReentrant {
        ...
        require(nextDeadline() < block.timestamp, "Deadline not passed");
        ...
}
```
```solidity
    function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
        ...
        for (uint i; i < indexes.length; i++) {
@>            require(offer.maxDeadline > block.timestamp, "Deadline passed");
        }
```

### Mitigation

Update the time check in payDebt()
```diff
-            require(offer.maxDeadline > block.timestamp, "Deadline passed");
+            require(offer.maxDeadline >= block.timestamp, "Deadline passed");
```
