# Malicious actors can continue to grief/DOS the matchOrder() function

### Summary

Malicious actors can continue to grief/DOS the matchOrder() function. This is possible because of the ```updateLendOrder()``` and ```updateBorrowOrder()``` function that exist in the LendOffer and BorrowOffer contract.

The original intention of the methods are to allow loan actors change their preferred parameters. The problem however, lies in the fact that there is no timelock for updates, and because of the parameter checks in ```matchOffersV3()``` bad actors can abuse the update functions to DOS ANOTHER USER OPERATION to match offers which were ORIGINALLY ALIGNED by front-running ```matchOffersV3()```.

While Arbitrum, Base and OP might not be vulnerable to this attack, Fantom is vulnerable and since protocol intends to deploy on Fantom, the isssue needs to be fixed

Q: On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?

### Root Cause

No timelock to updates, causing bad actors to grief HONEST connectors who helps with matching loan orders.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Front-running must be possible, Fantom deployments becomes vulnerable.

### Attack Path

Lenders/Borrowers can be malicious.
For Instance, consider Alice creating multiple lend orders that matches most borrow orders, making it very good for connectors to match, and while the matchOffersV3 is in process, Alice front-runs the transaction that includes her order to update ```newApr``` such that it deviates far away from the BorrowOffer ```maxApr```, causing the entire transaction to revert.  

This process can be repeated cheaply by increasing/decreasing Apr, and waiting for unsuspecting connectors to match orders that will FAIL/REVERT.

What does the attacker achieve doing this, discourages connectors from matching orders
Motive of attacker: could be a competitor trying to discredit the credibility of Debitav3Loan matching system 
Cost & Viability of Attack; gas cost is low on Fantom, but having connectors honest  txns revert builds bad re for Debita.

### Impact

Reversion of ```matchOfferV3()```
If duration changes
```solidity
 // check that the duration is between the min and max duration from the lend order
            require(
                borrowInfo.duration >= lendInfo.minDuration &&
                    borrowInfo.duration <= lendInfo.maxDuration,
                "Invalid duration"
            );
```
when ratio changes substantially 
```solidity
        // check ratio for each principle and check if the ratios are within the limits of the borrower
        for (uint i = 0; i < principles.length; i++) {
            require(
                weightedAverageRatio[i] >=
                    ((ratiosForBorrower[i] * 9800) / 10000) &&
                    weightedAverageRatio[i] <=
                    (ratiosForBorrower[i] * 10200) / 10000,
                "Invalid ratio"
            );
```
whem Apr increases substantially 
```solidity
 // check if the apr is within the limits of the borrower
            require(weightedAverageAPR[i] <= borrowInfo.maxApr, "Invalid APR");
```

### Mitigation

Implement a timelock on update.

This puts limitation on when an order can be updated, and gives connector assurance that there can be no sudden change in parameters.
