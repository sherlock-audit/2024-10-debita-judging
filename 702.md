# buyOrderFactory owner is unchangeable due to variable shadowing

### Summary

The parameter variable being the same name as the state variable name results in the former variable being overshadowed by the latter and the function being made useless

### Root Cause

Inside [buyOrderFactory](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186), the parameter variable 'owner' variable being the same name as the contract state variable named 'owner' result the changeOwner function being made useless due to the latter being overshadowed by the former.
```solidity
contract buyOrderFactory {
    address public owner;

  function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
``` 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. admin calls changeOwner to change the owner of the contract
2. nothing happens and a redeployment is necessary

### Impact

Admins wont be able to change owner of buyOrderFactory

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a temp variable name for the parameter variable
