# Lender will permanently lose collateral claim rights if they try to claim borrower’s NFT collateral before an auction is started due to incorrect state update

### Summary

In the event of a loan default (when a borrower fails to repay by the deadline) with NFT collateral, any lender involved in the loan can initiate the liquidation process by calling `createAuctionForCollateral()`. 

- This function starts a Dutch auction to sell the defaulted NFT.
- Once a buyer purchases the NFT and the underlying locked tokens are transferred to the `DebitaV3Loan` contract, lenders should be able to claim their proportional share through the `claimCollateralAsLender()` function, which internally calls `ClaimCollateralAsNFTLender()`.

However, there is a critical vulnerability in the `claimCollateralAsLender()` function that can result in permanent loss of collateral claim rights for lenders.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from an incorrect state update in `claimCollateralAsNFTLender()` where the function sets `collateralClaimed = true` **before** executing the actual claim logic.

- If the claim operation fails due to having multiple lenders and no auction being initialized, the `collateralClaimed` flag remains set to true, despite the failed claim.
- The function then returns `false` without reverting, and `claimCollateralAsLender()` does not check this return value.

- This sequence of events leaves the lender in a state where they can never claim their share of the collateral, as the flag incorrectly indicates the collateral has already been claimed.

This leaves the lender with:
- A burned ownership token
- No claimed collateral
- No way to try claiming again

Also, there is no onus on lenders ensuring that `createAuctionForCollateral()` has been called before they call `claimCollateralAsLender()` themselves, due to the fact that a single borrow can have multiple lend offers.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Loan uses NFT as collateral
- Loan has multiple lenders
- Borrower has failed to pay back the principle token amount and Loan is has defaulted
- No auction has been initialized
- Lender calls `claimCollateralAsLender()`

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is severe as it creates a **permanent loss of lender rights** in defaulted loans. 
- Lenders not only fail to receive their collateral but also lose their ownership token in the process.
- The lender becomes effectively locked out of the protocol, unable to recover their share of the defaulted collateral even after an auction is properly initialized.
- This results in a **complete financial loss** equivalent to their lending position

### Mitigation

In claimCollateralAsLender(), include a check on the return value from claimCollateralAsNFTLender.

```solidity
    function claimCollateralAsLender(uint index) external nonReentrant {
        // other code
        // claim collateral
        if (m_loan.isCollateralNFT) {
          require(claimCollateralAsNFTLender(index), "Claim failed")
        } else {
            // other code
    }
```
