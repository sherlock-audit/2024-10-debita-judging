# Listing actives borrow orders while a user has just deleted one (or multiple) borrow order will revert in DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol::getActiveBorrowOrders()

### Summary

The listing of active borrow orders may fail when one or more users delete their borrow orders at the same time.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L179
In `getActiveBorrowOrders()`there is a loop to gather all the active borrow orders desired by the user.
However, if one or more users deletes one or more borrowOrders while this loop is running, the length of `allActiveBorrowOrders` decreases. 
The loop will continue and reach an index that no longer exists in `allActiveBorrowOrders`.
The function will revert, giving the error “Index out of bounds”.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `AllActiveBorrowOrders` contains multiples borrowOrders

### Attack Path

1. a)User1 tries to list some actives BorrowOrders using `getActiveBorrowOrders()`
    a)User2 deletes his borrowOffer using `deleteBorrowOrders()` `(getActiveBorrowOrders()` is still running)
2. The loops in `getActiveBorrowOrders()`continues and reach the index just deleted
3. The function reverts with the error "Index out of bounds"

### Impact

Revert of the function `getActiveBorrowOrders()`

### Mitigation

At the start of the function, copy `allActiveBorrowOrders` into an in-memory array. Changes made to the original array will not affect the in-memory array at runtime.
```solidity
function getActiveBorrowOrders(uint offset, uint limit) external view returns (DBOImplementation.BorrowInfo[] memory) {
    address[] memory activeOrdersSnapshot = allActiveBorrowOrders; // Copie en mémoire

    uint length = limit;
 .
 .
.
}
```
