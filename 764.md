# Confidence interval check missing in Pyth network prices

### Summary

Pyth network shows how confident it is about its prices using something called a confidence range. For each price 'p', there's a number 'σ' that tells us how much that price could go up or down. The Pyth team has written guidelines about using this confidence range to make things safer. For example, you can divide 'σ' by 'p' - if this number is too big, you might want to stop trading until prices are more stable.

At the moment, the protocol isn't paying attention to this confidence range feature at all. It would be a good idea to start using it like Pyth suggests, as this would help stop people from taking advantage when prices aren't accurate. Here are the Pyth docs:

### Root Cause

Here is the vulnerable function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaPyth.sol#L25

### Internal pre-conditions

No internal conditions

### External pre-conditions

No external conditions

### Attack Path

A user might be able to take advantage of the incorrect price

### Impact

`MixOracle` uses `DebitaPyth` oracle in it's calculations. If the price returned is incorrect that would make all the contracts's calculation that use the `MixOracle` incorrect.

### PoC

No PoC

### Mitigation

Make sure this check is in the DebitaPyth::getThePrice function:

```solidity
error PriceConfidenceTooLow();

    if ((priceData.price / int64(priceData.conf) < minConfidenceRatio) && priceData.conf > 0 ) {
        revert PriceConfidenceTooLow();
    }
```
