# Aggregator Address can be  Set to address(0)  which can never be modified again

### Summary

The aggregatorContract is passed as an argument during the initialization of the contract, but if the address provided is address(0), it cannot be changed after deployment. This creates an issue as functions like acceptLendingOffer() and addFunds() depend on the aggregator to authorize actions, but address(0) cannot authorize them, effectively blocking these operations.


### Root Cause

in[DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L82]( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L82)

there is a missing check if the address(0) is not zero  and if it  address(0) then it cant be changed

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Once the contract is deployed with address(0) for the aggregatorContract, the lending offer cannot be accepted or updated, as the aggregator is an essential component for authorization. Since the aggregator address cannot be changed, the contract becomes unusable, locking the funds and preventing any lending actions.

which means 

```solidity
    modifier onlyAggregator() {
        require(msg.sender == aggregatorContract, "Only aggregator");
        _;
    }
```

```solidity
 function acceptLendingOffer(
        uint amount
    ) public onlyAggregator nonReentrant onlyAfterTimeOut {
  // Function logic
    }
```
this function cant be called because it only the aggregator that can call it 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that the aggregatorContract is always set to a valid, non-zero address before deployment.
Implement a fallback check during initialization to revert the transaction if aggregatorContract is set to address(0):

```solidity
require(_aggregatorContract != address(0), "Aggregator contract cannot be address(0)");
```

Add a function to allow changing the aggregatorContract address post-deployment, but restrict it to trusted addresses or the contract owner only, to avoid future issues:

```solidity
function setAggregatorContract(address _aggregatorContract) external onlyOwner {
    require(_aggregatorContract != address(0), "Aggregator contract cannot be address(0)");
    aggregatorContract = _aggregatorContract;
}
```
