# Missing Checks for Min/Max Price in Chainlink Oracle

### Summary

A lack of validation for returned price bounds in the `getThePrice` function will cause a mispricing vulnerability for the protocol as malicious actors or unforeseen price feed anomalies will allow invalid prices to propagate within the system.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaChainlink.sol:30` at `getThePrice()`, the implementation does not include checks for `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` values from the Chainlink Aggregator. This oversight allows the system to accept prices that are either too low (e.g., zero or near-zero during crashes) or excessively high.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Admin needs to set the price feed** to a valid address through the `setPriceFeeds()` function.
2. **isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed]** must be set to `true` for the price feed.


### External pre-conditions

1. The Chainlink price feed needs to provide a value below the valid `minAnswer` or above the `maxAnswer` due to a market anomaly or malfunction.
2. The protocol consuming the price feed must rely on the invalid price without additional validation.

### Attack Path

1. A malicious actor influences the underlying market or price feed in such a way that the Chainlink oracle provides an out-of-bounds price (e.g., a "crash" price).
2. The affected Chainlink price feed propagates the invalid price to the `getThePrice()` function.
3. The protocol using this price for calculations, transactions, or collateral valuation misprices assets, causing financial loss or destabilization.

### Impact

If a situation  like LUNA hack happens then the oracle will return the minimum price and not the crashed price.
The **protocol users** suffer from potential financial loss due to mispricing or incorrect collateral/liquidation calculations. The **attacker** may profit from the system's reliance on invalid prices, leading to significant economic damage or exploitation.

### PoC

The function did not check for the min and max price that can be retrieved from the Chainlink Aggregator 

### Mitigation

To avoid consuming stale prices when Chainlink freezesthe protocole needs to introduce explicit checks for `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` values provided by the Chainlink Aggregator. Below is a proposed solution:
Introduce explicit checks for `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` values provided by the Chainlink Aggregator. Below is a proposed solution:

```solidity
function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
    address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
    require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
    require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");

    AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

    if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
        checkSequencer();
    }

    (, int price, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

    require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
    require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
    require(updatedAt > block.timestamp - 1 hours, "Price data is stale");

    AggregatorV2V3Interface v2v3PriceFeed = AggregatorV2V3Interface(_priceFeed);
    int256 minAnswer = v2v3PriceFeed.minAnswer();
    int256 maxAnswer = v2v3PriceFeed.maxAnswer();

    require(price >= minAnswer, "Price below minAnswer");
    require(price <= maxAnswer, "Price above maxAnswer");

    return price;
}
```
