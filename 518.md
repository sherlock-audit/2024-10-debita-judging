# Oracle not whitelisted, allow user to control the token prices causing unfair borrowing/lending

### Summary

The `matchOffersV3` is called to match borrow and lending offers of which the borrowers and lenders specify the array of addresses of the oracles for each collateral and principles. These oracles are not whitelisted and can return arbitrary amount to manipulate prices.

### Root Cause

The `getPriceFrom` function is called with arbitrary oracle address, the returned price can be any arbitrary amount. This permits price manipulation.

```solidity
    function getPriceFrom(
        address _oracle,
        address _token
    ) internal view returns (uint) {
        require(oracleEnabled[_oracle], "Oracle not enabled");
        return IOracle(_oracle).getThePrice(_token);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1) Borrower creates their own control oracle contract with same function signature `getPriceFrom()`.

### Attack Path

1) Borrower creates borrow order with their own oracle address.
2) Oracle address for collateral returns inflated price.
3) Match order books assumes that collateral is high enough for lending order.
4) Executes the lend order for which borrower will not payback, effectively stealing from lender.

### Impact

Lender can lose their funds. Borrower also can lose their funds assuming that lender creates their oracle contract with the similar attack paths.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not allow user to specify arbitrary oracle address, instead, the protocol should specify them.
