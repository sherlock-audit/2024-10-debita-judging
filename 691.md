# No time check

### Summary

The comment said here should be a time check of the price no older than 20 minutes. While in pyth contract , there is no such time check.

### Root Cause

There is no time check in pyth contract so this is not aligned with comments. If the time is older than 20 minutes, the price returned from getThePrice may be not correct.
