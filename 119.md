# Lend offer can be deleted multiple times

### Summary

Lack of check in addFunds() function. This will cause one lend offer can be deleted twice.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaLendOffer-Implementation:178](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L178), there is one perpetual mode. 
Considering one scenario: The lend offer is in perpetual mode and current `availableAmount` equals 0. Now when we try to change perpetual to false, we will delete this lend order.
The problem is that we lack updating `isActive` to false in changePerpetual(). This will cause that the owner can trigger `changePerpetual` multiple times to delete the same lend order.
When we repeat deleting the same lend order in `deleteOrder`, we will keep decreasing `activeOrdersCount`. This will impact other lend offer. Other lend offers may not be deleted.

```solidity
    function changePerpetual(bool _perpetual) public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        require(isActive, "Offer is not active");
        lendInformation.perpetual = _perpetual;
        if (_perpetual == false && lendInformation.availableAmount == 0) {
            IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
            IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
        } else {
            IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
        }
    }
```
```solidity
    function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder {
        uint index = LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder];
        LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder] = 0;
        // switch index of the last borrow order to the deleted borrow order
        allActiveLendOrders[index] = allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1];
        LendOrderIndex[allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]] = index;
        // take out last borrow order
        allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);
        activeOrdersCount--;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates one lend order with perpetual mode.
2. Match Alice's lend order to let `availableAmount` to 0.
3. Alice triggers `changePerpetual` repeatedly to let `activeOrdersCount` to 0.
4. Other lend orders cannot be deleted.

### Impact

All lend orders cannot be deleted. This will cause that lend order cannot be cancelled or may not accept this lend offer if we want to use the whole lend order's principle.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

When we delete the lend order, we should set it to inactive. This will prevent changePerpetual() retriggered repeatedly.
```diff
     function changePerpetual(bool _perpetual) public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
         require(isActive, "Offer is not active");
 
         lendInformation.perpetual = _perpetual;
         if (_perpetual == false && lendInformation.availableAmount == 0) {
+            isActive = false;
             IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
             IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
         } else {
```
