The `function changeOwner` contains an issue caused by a naming conflict. The function accepts an argument named `owner` and attempts to assign its value to the owner state variable. However, because the parameter name shadows the state variable, the assignment operation only modifies the local owner parameter and does not affect the state variable. As a result, the ownership change is never successfully applied.

### Root Cause

state variable shadow.
