# iercapprove will revert on some erc tokens

### Summary

while approving the tokens for a perpetual loan owner for adding the amount to the offer  the protocol uses 

                IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);


And the "default" ERC20 behavior expects the `approve` function to return a boolean, however, some ERC20s like usdt  don't return a value.



### Root Cause

Some known tokens don't return a value on approvals, more info [[here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#missing-return-values)](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#missing-return-values), an example of this is USDT, which is mentioned that the protocol will use it
