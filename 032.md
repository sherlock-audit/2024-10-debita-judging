# buyOrder doesn't use current collateral price but amount, allowing unfair sales to be made.

### Summary

The implementation utilizes the underlying locked collateral amount in the veNFT without factoring in the market price for executing the buy order.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the `amount` that is multiplied with the `buyRatio` does not factor in the current collateral price. 

```solidity
        uint collateralAmount = receiptData.lockedAmount; // total erc20 locked in veNFT, also locked in receipt
        uint collateralDecimals = receiptData.decimals; // $AERO has 18 dp

        uint amount = (buyInformation.buyRatio * collateralAmount) /
            (10 ** collateralDecimals);
        require(
            amount <= buyInformation.availableAmount,
            "Amount exceeds available amount"
        );
```

### Attack Path

User A wants to buy cheap receipt tokens, so he creates a `buyOrder` of 0.8:1 ratio compared to the underlying amount of the receipt. On the other side User B, who has a receipt, wants quick liquidity for his receipt, so he interacts with the `buyOrder.sol` and calls `sellNFT` in order to get the liquidity from the buy order. 

User B has collateral amount of 100e18 $AERO token, that is worth currently $1.30. This is not factored into calculation. During the conversation of $DAI to AERO, USER A buys the receipt for 80 DAI instead of 104 DAI (80 * $1.30 = 104 DAI worth).

User A keeps receipt, User B the liquidity loses extra $26 from the sale.

### Impact

Seller loses liquidity due to selling receipt lesser than it is worth.

### Mitigation

Integrate oracle pricefeed to calculate the amount.
