# Some offers cant be matched due to oracle decimals mismatch in ratio calculation

### Summary

Consider this calculation in the matchOffersV3 function.
```solidity
uint principleDecimals = ERC20(principles[i]).decimals();

uint ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = (priceCollateral_BorrowOrder *
                        10 ** 8) / pricePrinciple; 

 // take 100% of the LTV and multiply by the LTV of the principle
uint value = (ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral *
                    borrowInfo.LTVs[indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder[i]]) / 10000;

                /**
                 get the ratio for the amount of principle the borrower wants to borrow
                 fix the 8 decimals and get it on the principle decimals
                 */
uint ratio = (value * (10 ** principleDecimals)) / (10 ** 8);
                ratiosForBorrower[i] = ratio;
```
Letâ€™s take a closer look at ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral.

PriceCollateral_BorrowOrder - price from the oracle to collateral.
pricePrinciple - price from the oracle (not necessarily the same on principle)

Oracle can return their prices in different dimensions, although actually most priceFeeds both chainlink and pyth return the answer in dimension 8. 

However, chainlink also has feeds with a dimension of 18. For example, priceFeed PEPE/USD in the network arbitrum has decimals= 18.

Thus, if principle_price is with decimals = 18 and collateral_price with decimals = 8, the whole calculation will be 0 due to the down-rounding.

So borrowerRatio for this principle will be 0 and not checked in this [line](So borrowerRatio for this principle will be 0 and not checked in this [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L536)

### Root Cause

Some priceFeeds can return with 18 decimals, although most returns with 8. 10 8 is not enough in this case. 

### Internal pre-conditions
The user should create an offer where oracle for collateral will return a response with dimension 8, and oracle for principle - 18.

### External pre-conditions



### Attack Path


### Impact
Borrower will never match such order. Broken functionality.

### PoC


### Mitigation

Handle this edge case or use 10 ^ 18 for multiplication.
