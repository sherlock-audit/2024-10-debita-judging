# USDC-blacklisted lend offer won't allow borrowers to pay their debt, thus lenders can seize their collateral

### Summary

When a borrower gets a loan, he can pay back his debt by calling the `DebitaV3Loan::payDebt()` function, which adds funds to the lender's offer: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/ce50bab1067574ae493f4062665b8e28611f2346/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L186-L236

```javascript
function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
            ...
            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                IERC20(offer.principle),
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                total
            );
            // if the lender is the owner of the offer and the offer is perpetual, then add the funds to the offer
            if (lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer) {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
                IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);
@>              lendOffer.addFunds(total);
            } else {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim = interest - feeOnInterest;
            }
```

However since the lender has full control of his lend offer contract, if he gets it blacklisted by USDC borrowers will not be able to return the owed debt. That means they will be defaulted and will go to liquidation, which will allow lender to seize their collateral.

### Root Cause

1. Protocol will use USDC, USDT which have blacklist functionality
2. When the user pays pack his debt, the specified amount is first transfered to the loan contract and then to the lend offer contract

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The lend offer contract must get blacklisted by USDC, USDT

### Attack Path

According to the [USDC's legal terms](https://www.circle.com/legal/usdc-terms) (Eligibility and Limitations) section: 

```javascript
- "By holding or using USDC, or accessing or using the USDC Services, you further represent and warrant that:

1. You are at least 18 years old, are not a Restricted Person, and are not holding USDC on behalf of a Restricted Person.  
2. You will not be using USDC or the USDC Services (as applicable) for any illegal activity, including, but not limited to, illegal gambling, money laundering, fraud, blackmail, extortion, ransoming data, terrorism financing, other violent activities..."
```

That means violating these regulations, a certain address can get blacklisted by the token itself. For example if the lender is dealing with crypto frauds or exactly money laundering by funding his lend offer contract with the illegal money: 

```javascript
    function addFunds(uint amount) public nonReentrant {
        require(msg.sender == lendInformation.owner || IAggregator(aggregatorContract).isSenderALoan(msg.sender), "Only owner or loan");
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        ...
    }
```

Both (1) and (2) points from the regulation will be breached. That means both the lender and it's lend offer contract can get temporary blacklisted so they can't receive any USDC. Which means when borrower is trying to pay his debt the lend offer contract will not be able to receive these tokens, hence the borrower will be defaulted and the lender can seize all of his collateral later on.
