# Borrowers will not be able to extend their loans if they call `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan()` just in time

### Summary

The insufficient check in [`DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L555) prevents borrowers from extending their loans if they call the function just in time. 

Currently, it only verifies that `nextDeadline > block.timestamp`. However, it should also allow loans to be extended when `nextDeadline == block.timestamp`, as the borrower has not yet missed the deadline in this case, and the loan is not defaulted.

Additionally, borrowers are only allowed to repay their debt before the loan is defaulted. Since they can still repay their debt at `block.timestamp == nextDeadline`, this further confirms that the check in `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan()` is not correctly implemented.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan.sol:555` there is an insufficient check on the relationship between `nextDeadline()` and the `block.timestamp`. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The borrower's offer has to be matched with a lending offer
2. The loan must not be defaulted.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A borrower calls `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan()` at `block.timestamp == nextDeadline()`, but it reverts.

### Impact

As a result, borrowers cannot extend their loans if they call `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan()` at the exact moment of the deadline. They should be able to extend their loans at `block.timestamp == nextDeadline()` since the deadline has not passed and the loan is not defaulted.

### PoC

Add the following test to `TwoLenderLoanReceipt.t.sol`:

```solidity
function testCannotExtendLoanIfNotDefault() public {
    MatchOffers();

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 864000);

    vm.startPrank(borrower);
        
    uint nextDeadline = DebitaV3LoanContract.nextDeadline();
    assertEq(nextDeadline, block.timestamp);

    AEROContract.approve(address(DebitaV3LoanContract), 100e18);
    vm.expectRevert("Deadline passed to extend loan");
    DebitaV3LoanContract.extendLoan();

    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

### Mitigation

The following should be changed in `DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan()`:

```diff
// function to extend the loan (only the borrower can call this function)
// extend the loan to the max deadline of each offer
function extendLoan() public {
    ... ...
    require(
-        nextDeadline() > block.timestamp,
+        nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp,
        "Deadline passed to extend loan"
    );
    ... ...
}
```
