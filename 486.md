# Legitimate Lend Orders Can Delete Arbitrary Lend Orders

### Summary

The lack of proper access control in the `deleteOrder` function allows a legitimate lend order to delete any other lend order, causing unauthorized deletion of lend orders for other users. A malicious lend order can exploit this by calling `deleteOrder` with the address of any lend order they wish to remove.



### Root Cause

In `DLOFactory.sol:103` {https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L102C4-L105C6}, the `deleteOrder` function does not verify that the caller (`msg.sender`) is the same as the lend order being deleted (`_lendOrder`). The modifer `onlyLendOrder` just checks if the address is a valid lender. This oversight allows any legitimate lend order to delete any other lend order, not just their own.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There must be at least one legitimate lend order registered in the system (the attacker).
2. Other lend orders exist in `allActiveLendOrders` that the attacker aims to delete.


### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker operates a legitimate lend order (`AttackerLendOrder`) registered in the system.
2. The attacker calls the `deleteOrder` function, passing in the address of another lend order (`VictimLendOrder`) they wish to delete.
3. The `onlyLendOrder` modifier checks that `msg.sender` (`AttackerLendOrder`) is legitimate, which it is.
4. The function proceeds without verifying that `msg.sender` is not the same as `_lendOrder`.
5. `VictimLendOrder` is deleted from `allActiveLendOrders`, and mappings are updated accordingly.
6. `VictimLendOrder` loses money that already transfered when called `createLendOrder`

### Impact

 - The affected lend orders suffer from unexpected removal from the platform.
 - Their lending offers are no longer active, wich leads to loss of funds of the users.
 - The attacker can eliminate competition or disrupt the lending market to their advantage.

### PoC

No PoC.

### Mitigation

Modify the `deleteOrder` function to ensure that only the lend order itself can delete its entry:

```solidity
function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder{
     require(msg.sender == _lendOrder, "Caller must be the lend order");
     ... //rest of code
}
```
