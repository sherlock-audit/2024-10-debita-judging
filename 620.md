# Use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom for ERC721 transfer

### Summary

In `DebitaV3Loan::claimCollateralAsNFTLender()` collateral NFT is being transferred to the lender, but if the lender is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.
As per the documentation of EIP-721:
```solidity
A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.
```
Ref: <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721>
As per the documentation of ERC721.sol by Openzeppelin
Ref: <https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/d11ed2fb0a0130363b1e82d5742ad7516df0e749/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol#L75-L91>
```solidity
/**
     * @dev Transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`.
     *
     * WARNING: Note that the caller is responsible to confirm that the recipient is capable of receiving ERC-721
     * or else they may be permanently lost. Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must
     * understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `from` cannot be the zero address.
     * - `to` cannot be the zero address.
     * - `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`.
     * - If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.
     *
     * Emits a {Transfer} event.

### Root Cause

In lines [403-407](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L403-L407) in `DebitaV3Loan::claimCollateralAsNFTLender()` collateral NFT is being transferred without considering the fact that the lender can be a contract that does not support ERC721 protocol

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If the lender is a contract that does not support the ERC721 protocol, the collateral NFT may become permanently locked in the contract. This can result in a significant loss for the lender and compromise the protocol’s credibility.

### PoC

The following steps can occur when collecting the collateral by the lender:
1.  A lender is matched with a borrower who has a veNFT as collateral where the underlying token is AERO
2. The lending order has AERO as acceptable collateral
4. The borrower defaults the loan
5. The lender claims the collateral NFT calling `claimCollateralAsLender()`, which will call `claimCollateralAsNFTLender()` and transfer the NFT to the lender

If the lender is a contract address without IERC721Receiver support, the NFT is transferred but cannot be retrieved, becoming irrecoverable.

### Mitigation

Replace `transferFrom` with `safeTransferFrom` to ensure recipient compatibility
