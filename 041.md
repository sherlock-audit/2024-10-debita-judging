# Unable to change owner of contracts due to shadowed variable declaration

### Summary

There are a few contracts that implement a function to change the owner. Because of how the owner variable is declared, the function will always revert when trying to change the owner address.

### Root Cause

The root cause is in how the variable `owner` is passed into the `changeOwner` function. It shadows the already initialized `owner` variable in the constructor.
```Solidity
 constructor(address _implementationContract) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        feeAddress = msg.sender;
        implementationContract = _implementationContract;
        deployedTime = block.timestamp;
    }
```
```Solidity
// change owner of the contract only between 0 and 6 hours after deployment
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```
Therefore whenever this function is called, it is going to check `msg.sender` against the new intended owner rather than the existing owner. The following contracts all have the same issue for this function

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Current owner attempts to call `changeOwner` function

### Impact

Unable to change the owner of certain contracts

### PoC

Can add a similar test to any of the contracts and it will revert when trying to change the address to any owner

```Solidity
function testChangeFactoryOwner() public {
        address newOwner = makeAddr("Bob");
        vm.prank(address(factory.owner()));
        vm.expectRevert("Only owner");
        factory.changeOwner(address(newOwner));
    }
```

### Mitigation

Fix the `owner` parameter
```Solidity
function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = _owner;
    }
```
