# No restrictions in DebitaIncentives.sol allows malicious users to farm rewards by creating and matching lend and borrow orders with 0 APR

### Summary

The ``DebitaIncentives.sol`` contract is used by users who wants to incentivize other users to create lend and borrow orders that utilize a certain principal token. Incentives are deposited for each principal for each epoch, which is 14 days. However when lenders and borrowers create orders via the [DebitaLendOfferFactory::createLendOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L124-L203) and the[DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory::createBorrowOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L75-L157) functions respectively, there are no restrictions on the duration and the APR, thus borrow and lend orders with duration of 0 seconds and 0 APR can be created. A couple of minutes before the epoch ends, a malicious user can check what is the amount for the ``totalUsedTokenPerEpoch`` parameter for certain token for the current epoch. If the amount is not that big, the malicious user can execute the below described attack. The [DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274-L647) function can be called by anyone, thus a malicious user can create a lend and borrow order with 0 APR and 0 seconds duration for an astronomical amount(flash loans can be utilized, as everything happens within the same transaction), and then match them, immediately repaying the loans, creating new orders and matching them again. The malicious actor would only have to a pay a minimum 0.2% fee to the protocol for creating a loan with a minimal duration. If a flash loan is utilized those fees would have to be paid as well. This results in a malicious actor tremendously diluting the incentives for honest users of the Debita protocol, and depending on the dollar amount of the incentives, and the tracked amount of the the ``totalUsedTokenPerEpoch`` provided by honest users, the attacker may be profitable, without risking any of his funds. 

### Root Cause

There are no restrictions when borrow and lend orders are created, borrow and lend orders with 0 APR and a duration of 0 seconds can exist. In the ``DebitaIncentives.sol`` contract, there are no restrictions on how long a loan should be, or a minimum APR. There is no locking mechanism of any kind. Also it doesn't matter when in the epoch orders were matched, incentives are distributed purely on the principal amounts used when matching the orders.

### Attack Path
Lets consider an example where someone has provided 5 WETH as incentives for the second epoch and for the USDC principal. The incentive is only for the lenders. Consider the price of WETH is 3000$
 - Honest users have created borrow and lend orders, and a total of 100_000e6 USDC has been borrowed/lend. The ``totalUsedTokenPerEpoch`` parameter will be equal to 100_000e6, and lenders will split the 5 WETH rewards based on their provided value. 
 - In the last block before the epoch ends(or several blocks beforehand, in order for the malicious user to guarantee his transaction will be executed on time), a malicious user sees that there are only  100_000e6 ``totalUsedTokenPerEpoch``.
 -  The malicious actor decides to create a borrow order with 0 APR, and 0 seconds duration, as well as a lender order with 0 APR and 0 seconds min duration and use USDC as a principal token. The collateral doesn't matter much (it only has to be whitelisted by the ``DebitaIncentives.sol`` contract), lets consider that the collateral is WETH. For easier calculations consider that the borrower put 200 WETH as collateral which is worth 600_000$, at a 100% ratio, the lender order provides 600_000e6 as a principal on 100% ratio as well, meaning that the borrow will receive 3_000e6 USDC for 1e18 WETH. 
 - The malicious actor calls the [DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274-L647) function, and only pays the minimum 0.2% fee for creating a loan. This is equal to 1200e6 USDC. 
 - If the above step is performed only once when the ``porcentageLent`` is calculated:
 ```solidity
 porcentageLent = (lentAmount * 10000) / totalLentAmount;
```
 - We get (600_000e6 * 10_000) / 700_000e6 ~ 8_571 which is ~85%. 85% from 5 WETH tokens is 4.25e18 tokens which is 12_750$. The attacker profited ~11_550$, and the non malicious lenders will split 2_250$ between them. 

### Impact
A malicious user can tremendously dilute the incentive rewards that borrowers should receive, and collect a percentage of those rewards. This is a direct theft of funds.
