# A malicious attacker can steal others' funds by creating orders using a self-coded malicious oracle and matching them with other orders

### Summary

Users can create orders with any oracles, and the protocol does not verify the validity of these oracles. Additionally, anyone can call the `DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3` function.

If a malicious attacker creates a harmful contract that implements the `getThePrice` function and uses this contract as an oracle to create orders, they can steal funds from other users.

### Root Cause

Users can create orders with any oracles and the protocol does not check the oracles are valid.

```solidity
        borrowOffer.initialize(
            aggregatorContract,
            msg.sender,
            _acceptedPrinciples,
            _collateral,
            _oraclesActivated,
            _isNFT,
            _LTVs,
            _maxInterestRate,
            _duration,
            _receiptID,
L119:       _oracleIDS_Principles,
            _ratio,
L121:       _oracleID_Collateral,
            _collateralAmount
        );
```

In the `DebitaV3Aggregator.getPriceFrom` function, it calculates the the token's price using these oracles.

```solidity
    function getPriceFrom(
        address _oracle,
        address _token
    ) internal view returns (uint) {
        require(oracleEnabled[_oracle], "Oracle not enabled");
        return IOracle(_oracle).getThePrice(_token);
    }
```

And, anyone can call the `DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3` function.
Let's assume that the malicious attacker creates the malicious contract which implements the `getThePrice` and creates orders using this contract as oracle.
If he matches his orders with other orders, he can steal another users' funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

- Alice creates a lend order with the principal token as `AERO` and the collateral token as `EQUAL`.
- A malicious attacker, Bob, creates a harmful contract whose `getThePrice` function returns an inflated price for the `EQUAL` token.
- Bob then creates a borrow order that is available to match with Alice's lend order, using the created contract as the oracle.
- If Bob calls `DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3` to match Alice's lend order with his borrow order, he can steal Alice's `AERO`.

### Impact

Malicious attackers can steal another users' funds.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Add the mechanism to check that the order's oracle is valid oracle.
