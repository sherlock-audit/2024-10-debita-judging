# The protocol does not account for the precision decimals of the `chainlink` oracle when retrieving the token's price

### Summary

The `latestRoundData()` function of chainlink oracle returns the price which contains precision decimals. However, the protocol does not take this into consideration when using the price. As a result, the order matching mechanism is compromised.

### Root Cause

The `DebitaChainlink.getThePrice` function gets the token's price from `chainlink` oracle from [L42](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/tree/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L40).

```solidity
L42:    (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```

And the returned price is used to match the lend and borrow orders in the `DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3()` function from [L350](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/tree/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L40) and L451.

```solidity
L350:       uint ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = (priceCollateral_BorrowOrder *
                10 ** 8) / pricePrinciple;
L451:       uint fullRatioPerLending = (priceCollateral_LendOrder *
                    10 ** 8) / pricePrinciple;
```

However, directly using the returned price is incorrect because it does not account for the precision decimals.

The `AggregatorV3Interface` has [`decimals()`](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#decimals:~:text=Get%20the%20number%20of%20decimals%20present%20in%20the%20response%20value.) function and it gets the number of decimals present in the response value.

```solidity
  function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
```

Thus, actual USD price of the token is `response value / decimals()`.
For `USDC / USD`, if the oracle returns the `price` as `999934` and `decimals() = 6`, the the price of `USDC` is `0.999934` USD.
However, the `DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3()` function uses `999934` and do not use `decimals()`.
As a result, `ratiosForBorrower` and `userUsedCollateral` are calculated incorrectly and this breaks the matching of lend and borrow orders.

### Internal pre-conditions

A user creates the order with `chainlink` oracle.

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The price that does not account for the `decimals()` breaks the order matching mechanism.
This causes user's loss of funds.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

It is recommended to modify the code to take into account the `decimals()` of the `AggregatorV3Interface` when using the token's price.
