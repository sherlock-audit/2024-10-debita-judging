# a malicious attacker can redirect feeAmount in  buyNFT :: Auction.sol to  another feeAddress

### Summary

In the [`constructor`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L101) factory is initialized as msg.sender. A malicious user could create a malicious contract say `MaliciousAuctionFactory.sol` implementing all functions and state variable as the one in the original `AuctionFactory.sol` . The malicious user calls [`createAuction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L68) thereby making his `MaliciousAuctionFactory.sol` the factory of the newly [`DutchAuction_veNFT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L81) created
The malicious attacker adjusts the state variable `auctionFee` and `publicationAuctionFee` in `MaliciousAuctionFactory.sol` so he can pay as much as little in this [`safeTransferFrom`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L128) and the malicious attacker eventually gets [`feeAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L135) in the `feeAddress` used in `MaliciousAuctionFactory.sol` when he calls [`buyNFT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L109) in the  newly [`DutchAuction_veNFT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L81) created

### Root Cause

initializing [`factory = msg.sender`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L101) in `Auction.sol`. This allows an attacker to create a malicious auction factory contract to create a new   `DutchAuction_veNFT` while adjusting(increasing) the feeAmount and feeAddress to his suit in the malicious factory contract. Thereby redirecting the feeAmount into the feeAddress in the malicious contract.

### Attack Path

i. The malicious attacker create a malicious contract `MaliciousAuctionFactory.sol` just like the original `AuctionFactory.sol`. 
ii. the malicious attacker initializes the `auctionFee` and `publicAuctionFee` in  `MaliciousAuctionFactory.sol` to a value as high as possible in order to reduce the amount paid in  [`safeTransferFrom`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L128) as much as possible
iii. The attacker calls [`createAuction`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L68) in `MaliciousAuctionFactory.sol`  thereby creating a new `DutchAuction_veNFT` 
iv. The attacker calls [`buyNFT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L109) in the newly created `DutchAuction_veNFT`  contract
v. The feeAmount is transferred to the feeAddress provided by the attacker in the `MaliciousAuctionFactory.sol` and also the attacker pays no or a very little amount in [`safeTransferFrom`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L128)


### Impact

The attacker manipulates the feeAmount and the protocol losses it to the attacker
