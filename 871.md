# Users can still add funds to cancelled/fullfiled offers and inherently redelete that offer which would cause other offers(last ones in the mapping) to be deleted

### Summary

In DLOImplementation.sol, the `addFunds` function allows users to add funds to a lend offer regardless of its active status. If a lend offer has been cancelled or fully utilized (availableAmount == 0), calling addFunds will increase availableAmount, and subsequently, if the offer is not perpetual, a subsequent call to the `cancelOffer` function will cause the `lendOrder` to be redeleted which would cause collisions between other others due to how the deletion algorithm was implemented.

`DebitaLendOfferFactory` deletes `lendOrders` by moving the deleteded order to index 0 and the last order to the previous index of the deleted order before subsequently decreasing the `activeOrdersCount` If an address gets deleted more that once that exposes a huge flaw in this logic since every `last lendOrder` will keep moving to index `0`. An attacker can repeat this process as many times as they want which would further damage the system since:
- Multiple `lendOrders` will share the same index 
- Unintended `lendOrders` will get "deleted"
- `activeOrderCount` will not be able to truly and accurately reflect the number of active orders 

The combination of the above issues would render any kind of record being kept by the protocol useless and grossly misleading, as well as other systems that would rely on it.

### Root Cause

- The ability of a lender to addFunds to an already Cancelled/Fulfilled `lendOrder`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Attacker will have to create a `lendOrder`
2. Attacker cancels or waits for the order to be fullfiled
3. Attacker calls the `addFunds` function in DLO-Implementation contract and then has the ability to cancel again.
4. Attacker repeats these steps over and over again. (twice is enough to cause harm to the protocol)
