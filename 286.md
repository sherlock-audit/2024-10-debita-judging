# Lenders attempting to claim collateral before the NFT auction starts cannot claim it after it is sold

### Summary

A potential issue arises when a lender calls `DebitaV3Loan::claimCollateralAsLender()` while the loan has more than one accepted offer before an auction is initialized, as this scenario is not properly handled.

This prevents the lender from initializing the auction and claiming the collateral in the future, as their ownership is burned.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan::claimCollateralAsLender()`, the scenario where a lender calls the function before the auction is initialized and the loan has more than one accepted offer is not properly handled.

`DebitaV3Loan::claimCollateralAsLender()` [invokes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L360-L361) `DebitaV3Loan::claimCollateralAsNFTLender()` if the collateral is an NFT. Although this function returns a `bool`, its return value is never checked. The call will succeed and burn the lender's ownership even if the return value is `false`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A loan with an NFT and more than one accepted offer must be active.
2. The borrower of that loan must have missed the deadline to repay their debt.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A lender calls `DebitaV3Loan::claimCollateralAsLender()` for a defaulted loan before its auction has been initialized.
2. The call will not revert, but their ownerhip will be burned.
3. Whenever the same lender calls `DebitaV3Loan::createAuctionForCollateral()` to create the auction or calls `DebitaV3Loan::claimCollateralAsLender()` to claim their collateral after the auction has been sold, the call will revert.

### Impact

This causes lenders to not be able to claim their collateral after the NFT has been sold. Furthermore, the lender cannot create an auction for the NFT.

### PoC

Add the following test to `TwoLenderLoanReceipt.t.sol`:

```solidity
function testDefaultAndCollateralAsLenderRevert() public {
    MatchOffers();

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 8640010);
    uint balanceBefore = IERC20(AERO).balanceOf(address(this));
        
    DebitaV3LoanContract.claimCollateralAsLender(0);

    uint balanceAfter = IERC20(AERO).balanceOf(address(this));
    assertEq(balanceAfter, balanceBefore);

    vm.expectRevert();
    DebitaV3LoanContract.claimCollateralAsLender(0);

    vm.expectRevert();
    DebitaV3LoanContract.createAuctionForCollateral(0);
}
```

### Mitigation

Consider adding a check to ensure that the call reverts if `DebitaV3Loan::claimCollateralAsNFTLender()` returns `false`.
