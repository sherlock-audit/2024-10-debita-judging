# changeOwner() Function Fails to Update Owner Due to Parameter Shadowing and Self Assignment

### Summary
The `changeOwner` function in buyOrderFactory.sol contains critical flaws that make ownership transfer impossible due to parameter shadowing and self-assignment issues. This permanently locks the contract's ownership to its initial owner.As well as the same problem in across all the protocol contracts which have `changeOwner()` function.

### Root Cause
Two  issues in the implementation:
1. Parameter shadowing: The `owner` parameter shadows the state variable `owner`
2. Self-assignment: `owner = owner` assigns the parameter to itself instead of updating the state variable

### Internal pre-conditions
- Contract must be within 6 hours of deployment
- Function must be called with a new owner address
- State variable `owner` must exist

### External pre-conditions
- Caller must provide an owner address parameter
- Transaction must occur within 6 hours of contract deployment

### Attack Path
1. Current owner calls `changeOwner(newOwner)`
2. First require check compares `msg.sender` with parameter instead of state variable
3. Second require check verifies 6-hour timeframe
4. Assignment `owner = owner` only reassigns parameter to itself
5. State variable remains unchanged

### Impact
- Ownership transfers are impossible
- Contract owner is permanently locked
- Critical admin functions may become inaccessible
- No way to update owner in case of key compromise
- Breaks contract upgradeability patterns

### PoC
```solidity
function test_ChangeOwner_ShouldRevert() public {
    address caller = makeAddr("caller");
    address differentAddress = makeAddr("other");

    vm.prank(caller);
    // vm.expectRevert("Only owner");
    factory.changeOwner(differentAddress); 
}
```
**Test output**
```javascript
[FAIL. Reason: revert: Only owner] test_ChangeOwner_ShouldRevert() (gas: 12089)
```
only in one case this function is going to be called correctly if msg.sender is initial owner and parameter address is also initial owner address. but this is useless because he is already owner.

### Mitigation
```solidity
function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");  // Use state variable
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = _newOwner;  // Update state variable with new owner
    emit OwnershipTransferred(owner, _newOwner);
}
```

Key fixes:
1. Rename parameter to avoid shadowing
2. Use state variable in authorization check
3. Properly assign new owner to state variable
4. Add event emission for ownership transfer
