# veAERO owner may lose some airdrop from veAERO

### Summary

In AERO's airdrop claim, it's possible to transfer airdrop token to the owner directly. This will cause the airdrop token locked in veNFTAerodrome contract.

### Root Cause

In [Debita Website](https://debita-finance.gitbook.io/debita-v3/receipts/venfts), it mentions that `By locking your veNFT, you retain all associated benefits such as voting power, rewards claiming, and lock extensions.`
There are one airdrop rewards for veAERO holders. Users can claim veAERO's airdrop rewards. 
When this veAERO is not permanent and this veAERO's unlock time reaches, anyone can trigger this veAERO's claim() to transfer airdrop rewards to the owner of veAERO.
In Debita, users will lock their veAERO into veNFTAerodrome contract to get one receipt to participate the Debita system. So the airdrop rewards will be transferred to veNFTAerodrome contract. The problem is that there is not any interface in [veNFTAerodrom](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/veNFTAerodrome.sol#L57) to allow the actual veAERO's owner to claim these airdrop rewards.

```solidity
    function claim(uint256 _tokenId) external returns (uint256) {
        if (IMinter(minter).activePeriod() < ((block.timestamp / WEEK) * WEEK)) revert UpdatePeriod();
        if (ve.escrowType(_tokenId) == IVotingEscrow.EscrowType.LOCKED) revert NotManagedOrNormalNFT();
        uint256 _timestamp = block.timestamp;
        uint256 _lastTokenTime = lastTokenTime;
        _lastTokenTime = (_lastTokenTime / WEEK) * WEEK;
        uint256 amount = _claim(_tokenId, _lastTokenTime);
        if (amount != 0) {
            IVotingEscrow.LockedBalance memory _locked = ve.locked(_tokenId);
            if (_timestamp >= _locked.end && !_locked.isPermanent) {
                address _owner = ve.ownerOf(_tokenId);
                IERC20(token).safeTransfer(_owner, amount);
            } else {
                ve.depositFor(_tokenId, amount);
            }
            tokenLastBalance -= amount;
        }
        return amount;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

1. veAERO is not permanent.
2. veAERO's unlock time reaches.

### Attack Path

Once the veAERO's unlock time reaches, anyone can trigger the claim() function to let the actual veAERO owner lose these airdrop rewards.

### Impact

The actual veAERO owner may lose some airdrop rewards.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Add one interface in veNFTAerodrome to allow the owner to withdraw common ERC20 tokens.
