# BuyOrder can not work well with TaxTokensReceipt

### Summary

TaxTokensReceipt NFT has one transfer limitation. This will block TaxTokensReceipt NFT's transfer. Users cannot sell their TaxTokensReceipt NFT.

### Root Cause

In [TaxTokensReceipts:transferFrom](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L93), there is one transfer limitation for TaxTokensReceipt NFT.
If both `from` and `to` addresses don't belong to borrow order, lend order or loan, the transfer will be reverted.
The problem is that the buyOrder is not in the TaxTokensReceipt's whitelist. Users cannot sell their NFT via `sellNFT`
```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public virtual override(ERC721, IERC721) {
        bool isReceiverAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(to) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(to) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(to);
        bool isSenderAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(from) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(from) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(from);
        // Debita not involved --> revert
        // At least, the sender or the receiver should be in borrowOrder, LendOrder, or the Loan.
        require(
            isReceiverAddressDebita || isSenderAddressDebita,
            "TaxTokensReceipts: Debita not involved"
        );
}
```
```solidity
    function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
        ...
@>        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            receiptID
        );
}
```
