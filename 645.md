# Auctions cannot be created for tokens that do not implement the `decimals` function

### Summary

When an auction is created, the contract retrieves the token number of decimals using the `decimals()` function, which is part of the ERC20Metadata standard.



### Root Cause

in `Auction.sol::78`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The issue is that not all ERC20 tokens provide such an interface meaning the call will not work and will revert.


Some tokens may not be compatible with the protocol


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Recommend using a tryCatch block to query the decimals. If it fails, hardcode it to 18 for scaling.
