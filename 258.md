# Broken Ownership Transfer Due to Parameter Shadowing and Self-Assignment

### Summary

Parameter shadowing in the `changeOwner` function combined with a self-assignment operation will cause a completely broken ownership transfer mechanism for the debita finance protocol administrators as ownership transfers will silently fail while appearing to succeed.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186-L189

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L50

In `buyOrderFactory.sol:186-190` the parameter `owner` shadows the state variable `owner` and is then used in a self-assignment operation (`owner = owner`), which assigns the parameter to itself rather than updating the state variable.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract owner needs to attempt to transfer ownership within 6 hours of deployment
2. Contract must have been deployed to initialize the initial `owner` state variable

### External pre-conditions

None - this is an implementation bug that doesn't depend on external conditions.

### Attack Path

1. Protocol administrator tries to transfer ownership by calling `changeOwner(newOwner)`
2. Call reverts because `msg.sender` (current owner) doesn't equal the `newOwner` parameter due to broken check
3. If attempted by the proposed new owner instead, function appears to succeed but ownership remains unchanged due to self-assignment

### Impact

The protocol administrators cannot transfer contract ownership, permanently locking the current owner as the contract owner forever. This breaks a critical administrative function and could prevent proper protocol management, particularly when the transfer of ownership is needed.

### PoC

POC Showcasing Issue

```solidity
   function testChangeOwnerBug() public {
        address originalOwner = factory.owner();
        address newOwner = address(0x123);


        // We have to prank as the address we're trying to change ownership to
        vm.startPrank(newOwner); // msg.sender must equal the owner parameter
        factory.changeOwner(newOwner); // This will pass the check since msg.sender == owner (parameter)
        vm.stopPrank();


        // But owner still won't change due to self-assignment
        assertEq(factory.owner(), originalOwner, "Owner should not have changed");
    }
```

1. We can see from the traces that:
   ```solidity
   Initial owner: [0x7FA9385bE102ac3EAc297483Dd6233D62b3e1496]
   changeOwner called by 0x123 targeting 0x123 (succeeds, doesn't revert)
   Final owner: [0x7FA9385bE102ac3EAc297483Dd6233D62b3e1496] (unchanged)
   ```

This test proves that:
   - The function allows the proposed new owner to call it (due to the broken check)
   - The function executes successfully (no revert)
   - The ownership does not change (due to self-assignment)

This demonstrates both problems:
   - Backwards access control: Only the new owner can call it (not the current owner)
   - Non-functional transfer: Even when called "successfully", ownership doesn't change

The function appears to work (doesn't revert) but fails to actually transfer ownership, and can only be called by the wrong party (proposed new owner instead of current owner).

### Mitigation

Recommended Fix:

- Renaming the parameter to avoid shadowing (e.g., newOwner)
- Correcting the access control to allow the current owner to initiate the transfer
- Properly assigning the state variable instead of self-assignment
