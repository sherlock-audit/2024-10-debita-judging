# Contracts cannot be upgraded because the implementationContract address is fixed and cannot be modified.

### Summary

In the `buyOrderFactory.sol` contract (also in `DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol` and `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol`), the variable [implementationContract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L52) stores the address of the implementation contract (logic) that the proxy will direct to. However, there is no function available to change this address later, preventing **upgrades** to a new version of the contract.

The `createBuyOrder()` function deploys a `DebitaProxyContract`, a proxy which directs to the same address of `implementationContract` (does not get the address as input parameter and again the address is unchangable)

Additionally, inside the DebitaProxyContract, there is no function to change the implementation address or upgrade the contract. The proxy library from OpenZeppelin, which is imported in it, is also not upgradable.

### Root Cause

In DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol, buyOrderFactory.sol, DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol contracts
there is no mechanism to change the address of `implementationContract` and upgrade the contract

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.	Deploy the buyOrderFactory.sol contract.
2.	Create a buy order using the createBuyOrder() function.
3.	Observe that the deployed DebitaProxyContract points to the implementationContract.
4.	Notice that there is no method available to change the address of implementationContract or upgrade the proxy contract to a new implementation.

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Three different solutions:
1.	Add a function to the mentioned contracts to allow upgrading (changing the implementationContract address).
2.	Ensure that the proxy contract allows changing the implementation address.
3.	If using OpenZeppelinâ€™s proxy, consider using an upgradable proxy such as TransparentUpgradeableProxy or UUPSProxy.
