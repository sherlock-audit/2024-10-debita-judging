# The NFT in the buyOrder contract will not be transferred to the owner

### Summary

In the `buyOrder` contract, the NFT seller will transfer the NFT to the contract, but there is no method for the owner to withdraw the NFT from the contract. This results in the owner's assets being permanently locked in the contract.

### Root Cause

In sellNFT function, nft receiver is address(this). It should be owner.
```solidity
    function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
        require(buyInformation.isActive, "Buy order is not active");
        require(
            buyInformation.availableAmount > 0,
            "Buy order is not available"
        );

        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            receiptID
        );
```

        require(buyInformation.isActive, "Buy order is not active");
        require(
            buyInformation.availableAmount > 0,
            "Buy order is not available"
        );

        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
-           address(this),
+           buyInformation.owner,
            receiptID
        );
