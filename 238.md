# Incorrect interest handling after loan extension leads to lender losses

### Summary

The incorrect handling of `interestToClaim` after a loan extension will cause lenders to lose accumulated interest. In the `extendLoan` function, additional interest is added to `interestToClaim`. However, during the `payDebt` function, this value is overwritten instead of being accumulated, preventing lenders from claiming the correct total interest and resulting in financial losses.

### Root Cause

In `extendLoan`, the `interestToClaim` for lenders is incremented to include extended interest:

```solidity
loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestToClaim += interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita;
```

However, in `payDebt`, the `interestToClaim` is overwritten instead of being accumulated:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L238-L240

```solidity
loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim = interest - feeOnInterest;
```

This overwriting causes the extended interest added in `extendLoan` to be lost, leading to incorrect interest claims for lenders.

interest is calculated from

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L721-L738

```solidity
 // subtract already paid interest
return interest - offer.interestPaid;
```

In `extendLoan`,

So paid interest can't be calculated and lender can't claim correct `interest` and `unclaimed interest` locked in contract.

### Attack Path

1. **Loan Extension:**
   - The borrower calls the `extendLoan()` function.
   - The `loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestToClaim` is incremented to account for the extended interest:
     ```solidity
     loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestToClaim += interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita;
     ```

2. **Debt Payment:**
   - The borrower calls the `payDebt()` function.
   - During the payment process, the `interestToClaim` is **overwritten**, not accumulated:
     ```solidity
     loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim = interest - feeOnInterest;
     ```

3. **Lender Interest Loss:**
   - The overwritten `interestToClaim` does not include the extended interest from `extendLoan`.
   - Lenders can only claim the new overwritten value, losing the additional interest added during the extension.

4. **Result:**
   - Lenders experience a financial loss as they are unable to claim the full interest owed, despite the loan being extended and additional interest being calculated.

### Impact

Lenders lose the original interest accumulated before `extendLoan` as `payDebt` overwrites `interestToClaim`. They can only claim the interest calculated after the extension, leading to financial loss and unfair treatment.

### Mitigation

 **Accumulate `interestToClaim` in `payDebt`:**  
   Update `payDebt` to add the new interest to the existing `interestToClaim` instead of overwriting it:
   ```solidity
   loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim += interest - feeOnInterest;
   ```
