# Borrower is Unable to Repay Debt to Other Lenders If Any Earliest Lender's Repayment is Missed After Extended Loan Time

### Summary

If the borrower calls `extendLoan` function then the repayment time for all lender increases to their maxDuration(maxDeadline) if they have not paid yet. However the `maxDuration` of all lenders might not same, which means if a borrower misses repayment of any one lender , then due to `nextDeadline` functionality which is checking the `maxDeadline` of each lender will revert due to that one lender's `deadline` passed.
```solidity
    function nextDeadline() public view returns (uint) {
        uint _nextDeadline;
        LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
>        if (m_loan.extended) {
>            for (uint i; i < m_loan._acceptedOffers.length; i++) {
                if (
                    _nextDeadline == 0 &&
                    m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].paid == false
                ) {
>                   _nextDeadline = m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].maxDeadline;
                } else if (
                    m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].paid == false &&
                    _nextDeadline > m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].maxDeadline
                ) {
                    _nextDeadline = m_loan._acceptedOffers[i].maxDeadline;
                }
            }
        } else {
            _nextDeadline = m_loan.startedAt + m_loan.initialDuration;
        }
        return _nextDeadline;
    }
```

### Root Cause

The `nextDeadline()` function checks the `maxDeadline` of each lender's offer after `extendLoan`. And the `extendLoan` function extends the repayment time to the `maxDeadline` of each lender's offer if they not paid yet:
```solidity
uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - alreadyUsedTime - block.timestamp; 
```
However the each lenders `maxDeadline` can be different, so if borrower misses repayment of least `maxDeadline` lender offer, then he will not be able to pay debt for other lenders due to `nextDeadline()` implementation.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The borrower `extendLoan` for each lender, since that time he did not pay anyone. After extended time if borrower were not able to repay earliest `deadline` lender among all will cause issue for borrower since he will not able repay other later `deadline` lender's.

### Attack Path

The `deadline` is checked like, if any earliest `deadline` lender does not receive repayment then borrower is unable to repay other remaining lenders.

### Impact

Once one loan defaults, it becomes impossible to repay other loans that are still within their deadline. 
Unnecessary liquidations of borrower's collateral.

### Mitigation

The deadline check should be performed independently for lenders.
