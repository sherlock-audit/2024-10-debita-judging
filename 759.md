# Underflow Risk and Invalid Offset Handling in Retrieval Functions

### Summary
Three functions (`getActiveBorrowOrders`, `getActiveAuctionOrders`, and `getActiveOrders`) have a similar issue where the code does not validate that the offset is less than the calculated length before attempting an array operation. This omission can lead to an underflow during the calculation of array size (length - offset), resulting in a revert or unintended behavior.

### Code Snippet:
`DBOFactory`

`DLOFactory`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L226-L233
`AuctionFactory`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L121-L129

`DebitaV3Aggregator`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L698-L706

### Affected Functions
`getActiveBorrowOrders`
`getActiveAuctionOrders`
`getActiveOrders`
`getHistoricalAuctions`
`getAllLoans`

### Vulnerability Details
## Issue: Unchecked Offset Value
All five functions assume that the `offset` provided as input will always be valid relative to the `activeOrdersCount`/`historicalAuctions.length` and `limit`. However, if `offset` exceeds or equals length (determined by the smaller of `limit` or `activeOrdersCount`/`historicalAuctions.length`), the subtraction length - offset results in Zero or an underflow.

## For Example:
If activeOrdersCount/historicalAuctions.length = 5, limit = 10, and offset = 7, the following occurs:
length = 5 (since limit > activeOrdersCount/historicalAuctions.length).
length - offset = 5 - 7, which results in an underflow.
This reverts the transaction or create unexpected behavior.

Specific Lines of Concern:

`getActiveBorrowOrders`:
```solidity
DBOImplementation.BorrowInfo[] memory result = new DBOImplementation.BorrowInfo[](length - offset);
```

`getActiveAuctionOrders`:
```solidity
DutchAuction_veNFT.dutchAuction_INFO[] memory result = new DutchAuction_veNFT.dutchAuction_INFO[](length - offset);
```

`getActiveOrders`:
```solidity
DLOImplementation.LendInfo[] memory result = new DLOImplementation.LendInfo[](length - offset);
```

`getHistoricalAuctions`
```solidity
DutchAuction_veNFT.dutchAuction_INFO[] memory result = new DutchAuction_veNFT.dutchAuction_INFO[](length - offset );
```

`getAllLoans`
```solidity
DebitaV3Loan.LoanData[] memory loans = new DebitaV3Loan.LoanData[](limit - offset);
```

Potential Impact:

Reverts: The underflow will cause the transaction to fail unnecessarily.
Invalid Data Handling: Even if a revert does not occur, it will return an empty array.

### Mitigation
1. Validate the Offset: Add a check to ensure offset is within the valid range before proceeding with any operations. This prevents the underflow and ensures consistent behavior.
Updated Validation Code:

```solidity
require(offset < activeOrdersCount, "Offset exceeds total orders");
```

2. Adjust the Array Length Calculation: Ensure that the array initialization accounts for the offset by using a conditional or calculated length:

```solidity
uint length = limit;
if (limit > activeOrdersCount) {
    length = activeOrdersCount;
}
require(offset < length, "Invalid offset"); // Additional check
uint resultLength = length > offset ? length - offset : 0;
```
