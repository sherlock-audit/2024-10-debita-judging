# First Lend Order Vulnerable Due to Zero-Based Indexing in `createLendOrders` Function

### Summary

The zero-based indexing of lend orders in the `createLendOrders` function leads to critical vulnerabilities. Specifically, when the first lend order is indexed at 0, it can be unintentionally overwritten or deleted due to the default behavior of mappings in Solidity, which return 0 for non-existent keys. This issue allows an attacker to manipulate the function to target the first lend order without proper authorization.

### Root Cause

In `DLOFactory.sol:187` function `createLendOrders` {https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L185C9-L189C29} it indexes:
```solidity
LendOrderIndex[address(lendOffer)] = activeOrdersCount;
```
The first lend order is indexed at 0, since `activeOrdersCount` starts at 0.
This is a critical issue when we look at the function `deleteOrder`:
```solidity
    function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder {
        uint index = LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder];
    ->  LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder] = 0;

        // switch index of the last borrow order to the deleted borrow order
        allActiveLendOrders[index] = allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1];
        LendOrderIndex[allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]] = index;

        // take out last borrow order
        allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

        activeOrdersCount--;
    }
```
1. The variable `index` becomes 0, the same `index` as the first legitimate lend order.
2. The function proceeds to overwrite `allActiveLendOrders[0]` (the first lend order) with the last lend order in the array.
3. This effectively deletes or corrupts the first lend order, regardless of which _lendOrder address was provided. (*explained in issue#1*)

### Internal pre-conditions

1.  `activeOrdersCount` is greater than 0, indicating that there are active lend orders in the system.
2. An attacker provides an `_lendOrder` address that is not a legitimate lend order (i.e.,` isLendOrderLegit[_lendOrder]` is `false`).

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions are required.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker operates a legitimate lend order (`AttackerLendOrder`) registered in the system.
2. The attacker calls the `deleteOrder` function, passing in an invalid `_lendOrder` address that is not registered.
3. The `onlyLendOrder` modifier checks that `isLendOrderLegit[msg.sender]` is `true`, which it is for `AttackerLendOrder`.
4. There is no check to verify that `msg.sender` matches the `_lendOrder` being deleted. (*issue#1*)
5. Since `InvalidLendOrder` is not in `LendOrderIndex`, it returns the default value 0.
6. The function proceeds to overwrite `allActiveLendOrders[0]` (the first lend order) with the last lend order in the array.
7. The mappings and `activeOrdersCount` are updated, effectively deleting or corrupting the first lend order.

### Impact

 - The legitimate owner of the first lend order suffers from unexpected deletion of their lend order.
 - The internal state of the contract is corrupted, leading to inconsistencies in allActiveLendOrders and LendOrderIndex.
 - The attacker can disrupt the lending market, eliminate competition, or cause denial of service to other users.
 - Loss of funds for the owner of the first lend order.

### PoC

No PoC.

### Mitigation

1. In the function `createLendOrders`, index the first lend order as 1.
2. In the function `deleteOrder` add this checks:
```solidity
function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external {
    require(msg.sender == _lendOrder, "Caller must be the lend order");
    require(isLendOrderLegit[_lendOrder], "Invalid lend order");
    
    ... rest of code
```
