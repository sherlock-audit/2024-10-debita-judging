# The `DebitaV3Loan::payDebt` does not allow borrower to repay thier debt at the last second

## Impact
### Summary 
The `DebitaV3Loan::payDebt` function is designed to allow a borrower to repay their debt within the loan duration they specified in thier borrow order. Where the loan duration has expired, the borrower cannot repay the debt any longer and loses thier collateral.
However, the `DebitaV3Loan::payDebt` function reverts if called at the last second, causing the borrower to loss their collateral when the loan duration has in fact not ended.

### Vulnerability Details
This vulnerability exists because the `DebitaV3Loan::payDebt` function requires `offer.maxDeadline > block.timestamp` instead of `offer.maxDeadline >= block.timestamp`. Thus meaning that even if `offer.maxDeadline = block.timestamp` (i.e. the last second of the loan duration), the function reverts and the borrower is not able to repay thier debt.
The link to the affected function is https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L186-L257 or can be seen in the code snippet below

```javascript
    function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
        .
        .
        .
        for (uint i; i < indexes.length; i++) {
            uint index = indexes[i];
            // get offer data on memory
            infoOfOffers memory offer = loanData._acceptedOffers[index];


            // change the offer to paid on storage
            loanData._acceptedOffers[index].paid = true;


            // check if it has been already paid
            require(offer.paid == false, "Already paid");


@>          require(offer.maxDeadline > block.timestamp, "Deadline passed");
            uint interest = calculateInterestToPay(index);
            uint feeOnInterest = (interest * feeLender) / 10000;
            uint total = offer.principleAmount + interest - feeOnInterest;
            address currentOwnerOfOffer;

    .
    .
    .

    }
```


### Impact
Since the `DebitaV3Loan::payDebt` function reverts when `offer.maxDeadline = block.timestamp` being the last second of the loan duration, the borrower is wrongly denied the opportunity to repay thier debt. This results in the borrower losing the collateral they used to obtain the loan when they shouldn't logically since the loan duration has not yet elapsed.


## Proof of Concept
1. Borrower creates a borrower order such that the value of `_duration` is the maxDuration of any of the available lend orders on the protocol.
2. Borrower attempts to repay their debt calling the `payDebt` function when `offer.maxDeadline = block.timestamp`. The call reverts with "Deadline passed" message.

<summary>PoC</summary>

Firstly, go to the `setUp` function in `MultiplePrinciples.t.sol` and adjust the `_duration` parameter in the `createBorrowOrder` function so that it looks as below

```javascript
address borrowOrderAddress = DBOFactoryContract.createBorrowOrder(
            oraclesActivated,
            ltvs,
            1400,
            8640000, // @audit-note adjusted by adding an extra zero
            acceptedPrinciples,
            USDC,
            false,
            0,
            oraclesPrinciples,
            ratio,
            address(0x0),
            40e18
        );
```

Now, place the following code into `MultiplePrinciples.t.sol`.

```javascript
function test_SpomariaPoC_BorrowerCantRepayDebtAtLastSecond() public {

        matchOffers();
        // get loan info
        DebitaV3Loan.LoanData memory loanData = DebitaV3LoanContract
            .getLoanData();
        uint[] memory indexes = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(3);
        indexes[0] = 0;
        indexes[1] = 1;
        indexes[2] = 2;
        vm.startPrank(borrower);
        deal(wETH, borrower, 10e18, false);
        AEROContract.approve(address(DebitaV3LoanContract), 10e18);
        wETHContract.approve(address(DebitaV3LoanContract), 10e18);

        vm.expectRevert("Deadline passed");
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 8640000); // fast forward the time to the maximum allowable time for repyament of debt
        vm.roll(10);
        DebitaV3LoanContract.payDebt(indexes);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // assert that the deadline has not passed
        assertEq(DebitaV3LoanContract.nextDeadline(), block.timestamp);
    }  
```

Now run `forge test --match-test test_SpomariaPoC_BorrowerCantRepayDebtAtLastSecond -vvvv`

Output:
```javascript

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider adjusting the affected portion of `DebitaV3Loan::payDebt` function to require that `offer.maxDeadline >= block.timestamp` instead of `offer.maxDeadline > block.timestamp`. This way a borrower can successfully repay their debt even at the last second of their loan duration.

```diff
function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
        .
        .
        .
        for (uint i; i < indexes.length; i++) {
            uint index = indexes[i];
            // get offer data on memory
            infoOfOffers memory offer = loanData._acceptedOffers[index];


            // change the offer to paid on storage
            loanData._acceptedOffers[index].paid = true;


            // check if it has been already paid
            require(offer.paid == false, "Already paid");


-           require(offer.maxDeadline > block.timestamp, "Deadline passed");
+           require(offer.maxDeadline >= block.timestamp, "Deadline passed");
            uint interest = calculateInterestToPay(index);
            uint feeOnInterest = (interest * feeLender) / 10000;
            uint total = offer.principleAmount + interest - feeOnInterest;
            address currentOwnerOfOffer;

    .
    .
    .

    }
```
