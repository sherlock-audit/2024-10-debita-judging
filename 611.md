# USDT Approval Pattern Causes DOS in Loan Operations

### Summary

The direct approval pattern used in DebitaV3Loan.sol will cause denial of service (DOS) for USDT-based loans as USDT requires allowance to be reset to 0 before setting a new value. This affects core loan operations including extensions and interest payments.


### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan.sol`, direct approve calls are made without following USDT's required approval pattern:

```solidity
// Line 242:
IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);

// Line 661:
IERC20(offer.principle).approve(
    address(lendOffer),
    interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita
);
```

The issue arises because:
1. USDT requires allowance to be reset to 0 before setting a new non-zero value
2. Contract uses direct approve calls without resetting
3. No handling of USDT's specific approval requirements
4. Multiple functions affected due to reuse of approval pattern

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Loan must use USDT as principle token
2. Contract must have an existing non-zero USDT allowance
3. User must attempt to perform an operation requiring approval (extend loan, pay interest)

### External pre-conditions

None - USDT's behavior is consistent across all networks

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol suffers from severe functionality loss for USDT-based loans:

1. Loan Extensions: Blocked
2. Interest Payments: Failed


This effectively makes the protocol unusable for one of the most common stablecoins in DeFi.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Replace direct approve calls with SafeERC20's pattern
