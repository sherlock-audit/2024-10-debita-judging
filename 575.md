# Unauthorized initialization of `DebitaV3Loan` contract

### Summary

The `DebitaV3Loan` contract allows any user to call the `initialize()` function and set themselves as the owner, bypassing the intended initialization process via the `DebitaV3Aggregator`. This vulnerability arises because the implementation contract is deployed without locking the `initialize()` function, leaving it exposed to malicious actors.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is the absence of a mechanism to lock the `initialize()` function in the `DebitaV3Loan` contract. Since `DebitaV3Loan` is deployed before `DebitaV3Aggregator`, the `initialize()` function is callable by any user until a proxy uses it. This allows a malicious actor to:

1. Deploy the `DebitaV3Loan` contract.

2. Call `initialize()` directly, setting themselves as the owner and initializing the contract.

3. Exploit ownership to manipulate the contract's state or assets.

The lack of protection in the constructor to prevent direct initialization is the fundamental flaw.

### Attack Path

1. Deploy the `DebitaV3Loan` contract.

2. Call the `initialize()` function directly with arbitrary parameters.

3. Become the contract owner and gain full control over the contract.

4. Exploit the contract by misusing its functionality or causing it to behave unpredictably.

### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is severe:

1. **Unauthorized Ownership**: Malicious actors can gain control of the `DebitaV3Loan` contract.

2. **Asset Theft**: If assets are transferred to this contract before proper initialization, the attacker can steal them.

3. **System Integrity**: The integrity of the `DebitaV3Aggregator` and the entire borrowing/lending process is compromised as unauthorized contracts can be treated as legitimate.

### Mitigation

To prevent this vulnerability, use the OpenZeppelin-provided `_disableInitializers()` function to lock the `DebitaV3Loan` contract upon deployment. This ensures the `initialize()` function cannot be called on the `DebitaV3Loan` contract itself.

**Recommended Fix**

Modify by adding constructor in `DebitaV3Loan` as follows:

```solidity
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
``` 

This guarantees the `initialize()` function is only callable on proxies and not on the `DebitaV3Loan` contract directly.
