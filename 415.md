# Short loans with <5 day duration cannot be extended due to incorrect logic

### Summary

The `extendLoan()` function will calculate the missing borrow fee that has to be paid to account for the extra duration. The `feeOfMaxDeadline` value is calculated incorrectly, but this is a separate finding - so let's assume it does what it should:  calculates the fee for a loan of `lendInfo.maxDuration` duration. It's possible that the borrower decided on a short-term loan with 3a -day duration, but after >10% of the 3 days they attempted to extend it. Due to incorrect logic the call to `extendLoan()` will revert for any short loans when any of the unpaid lend offers have a max duration of < 5 days.


### Root Cause

The `feeOfMaxDeadline` value is checked against `feePerDay` instead of `minFee`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L606-L608
So when `feeOfMaxDeadline` is less than `0.2%`, it will not change ( unless it's a VERY short loan where lend offer `maxDuration` is <1 day which is unlikely and the issue still persists ). This will lead to underflow revert for any lend offer with `maxDuration` less than 5 days:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L610
This is because if `maxDuration` is less than 5 days the `initialDuration` of the loan must be less than that as well, and in that case `PorcentageOfFeePaid` equal to `minFee` or `0.2%` is larger than `feeMaxDuration`. 

### Internal pre-conditions

- loan with `initialDuration` less than 5 days is created
- at least one of the lending offers from that loan has a `maxDuration` larger than `initialDuration` but still below 5 day mark 
- borrower attempts to extend such loan when one of the lending offers from the previous point is still unpaid
Essentially, an attempt to extend a short-term loan.

### Impact

Extension functionality is completely broken for loans with <5 day duration due to an unwanted underflow revert.


### PoC


For the PoC to work, change the duration of the borrow order to  `259200` (3 days):
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/test/fork/Loan/ltv/OracleOneLenderLoanReceipt.t.sol#L135
and the max duration for the lend order to `302400` (3.5 days): 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/test/fork/Loan/ltv/OracleOneLenderLoanReceipt.t.sol#L154

Unfortunately, the `extendLoan()` function has a separate root cause which cause the `feeOfMaxDeadline` to always be larger than `maxFee` - this is explained in another finding. To successfully even REACH the `if else` branch, the following change is necessary :
```solidity
  uint feeOfMaxDeadline = (((offer.maxDeadline - m_loan.startedAt)  * feePerDay) /
                        86400);
```
The details of why this is needed are in the separate finding. 

Add the following test case to the test file:
```solidity
    function test_shortLoanCannotBeExtended() public {
        MatchOffers();
        uint[] memory indexes = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
        indexes[0] = 0;
        vm.startPrank(borrower);

        AEROContract.approve(address(DebitaV3LoanContract), 100e18);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 86400); // 1/3 days of the loan pass
        vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);
        DebitaV3LoanContract.extendLoan();
    }

```
and import `stdError`:
```diff
-import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
+import {Test, stdError, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
```
Run it with:
```shell
 forge test --fork-url https://mainnet.base.org --fork-block-number 21151256  --mt test_shortLoanCannotBeExtended 
```


### Mitigation

Use `minFEE` instead of `feePerDay` for `feeOfMaxDeadline` validation:
```diff
   } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < minFEE) {
                        feeOfMaxDeadline = minFEE;
                    }
```
