# no minanswer/maxanswer  check in oracle

### Summary

    function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);


        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();


        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }

 the contract does not implement a min/maxanswer check there should be an implementation to ensure the returned prices are not at the extreme boundaries (`minAnswer` and `maxAnswer`).
Without such a mechanism, the contract could operate based on incorrect prices, which could lead to an over- or under-representation of the asset's value, potentially causing significant harm to users

Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. This would allow user to continue borrowing with the asset but at the wrong price
tokens like eth/usd use minanswer/maxanswer which is used in the contract

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

* Present price of TokenA is \$10
* TokenA has a minimum price set at \$1 on chainlink
* The actual price of TokenA dips to \$0.10
* The aggregator continues to report \$1 as the price

### Impact

The potential for misuse arises when the actual price of an asset drastically changes but the oracle continues to operate using the `minAnswer` or `maxAnswer` as the asset's price


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

the minPrice/maxPrice could be checked and a revert could be made when this is returned by chainlink
