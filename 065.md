# USDT Approval Logic Causes Reversion

### Summary

The contracts are designed to support `any ERC20 that follows exactly the standard (eg. 18/6 decimals)`. This means that they should support also USDT. However, the `DebitaV3Loan` contract will not work with USDT, as it will revert during the `extendLoan()` and `payDebt()` functions.

### Root Cause

A boolean return value is expected when calling the `approve()` function. However, USDT's implementation of the approve() function does not return a boolean value, which causes the contract to revert during execution. The functions `extendLoan()` and `payDebt()` in the contract expect a boolean return value, causing them to revert when interacting with USDT.
