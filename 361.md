# Incentive Tokens Will be Stuck.

### Summary

The `DebitaIncentives::claimIncentives()` function calculates incentive percentages with low precision, resulting in users receiving fewer incentives than they are entitled to. This discrepancy also causes unclaimed tokens to accumulate and remain stuck in the contract indefinitely.

### Root Cause

1. The issue stems from the [DebitaIncentives::claimIncentives()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L142-L214) function, specifically the calculation of incentive percentages:
```solidity
    porcentageLent = (lentAmount * 10000) / totalLentAmount;
```
The precision of `10000` causes rounding down, leading to inaccuracies of up to `0.01%`.
Users with very small percentages (e.g., `0.00999%`) receive no incentives, losing their rewards entirely.

2. Additionally, there is no mechanism in the contract (e.g., a withdrawal function) to recover or redistribute the unclaimed tokens, leaving them permanently locked in the contract.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Let us consider a extreme case:
1. Suppose there are `10001` lenders in the protocol, each entitled to an incentive share of approximately `0.009999%`.
2. Since the calculated percentage rounds down to zero for all lenders, none of them can claim their incentives.
3. Consequently, all incentive tokens remain stuck in the contract indefinitely.


### Impact

- Users lose a portion (or all) of their entitled incentives due to rounding errors.
- Unclaimed tokens stuck, leading to a loss of functionality and usability for the contract.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Increase precision: Use a larger precision factor, such as `1e18`, instead of `10000`
- Add a withdraw function to the contract.
