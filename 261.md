# A borrower/lender can not take token due to USDC blacklisted.

### Summary

Some ERC-20 tokens like for example USDC (which is used by the system) have the functionality to blacklist specific addresses, so that they are no longer able to transfer and receive tokens. Sending funds to these addresses will lead to a revert.

### Root Cause

The `DebitaV3Loan` contract uses direct transfers to the lenders/borrowers in several places, which will revert tx for them due to usdc blacklist functionality.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

Or check for blacklist.
