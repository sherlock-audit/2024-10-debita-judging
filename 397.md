# `feePerDay` is not charged when a borrower repays a loan

### Summary

When a borrower extends their loan, the `PorcentageOfFeePaid` is calculated based off the `feePerDay` for the `m_loan.initialDuration`. 
There is a `misingBorrowFee` which is calculated as the extra fee that should be paid due to the extension

The problem is that when a borrower  pays their debt, the `feePerDay` for the initial loan duration is not charged when `payDebt()` is called and hence it is not payed.
