The following is the extract from the [contest's README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3-xiaoming9090?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate):

> Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?

> - Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in TaxTokensReceipt contract

Thus, Fee-on-Transfer (FOT) tokens are supported within the protocol as long as it is wrapped within the `TaxTokensReceipt contract`.

The protocol has a buy order feature. Following is the extract from the [documentation](https://debita-finance.gitbook.io/debita-v3/marketplace/limit-order)

> 'Buy Order' feature on Debita V3 Marketplace. This concept allows users to create buy orders, providing a mechanism for injecting liquidity to purchase specific receipts at predetermined ratios. This development ensures that receipt holders can access immediate liquidity upon sale.

Assume Bob has 10,000 FOT and wants to use it to purchase veAERO NFT receipt. Thus, he has to wrap the 10,000 FOT into protocol `TaxTokensReceipt` receipt NFT and create a buy order.

However, it was found that the `buyOrderFactory.createBuyOrder` function at Line 101 uses the ERC20's transfer, which will not be able to transfer the `TaxTokensReceipt` receipt NFT into the buy order, and a revert will occur. In this case, the buy order feature is broken.

091:         _createdBuyOrder.initialize(
092:             msg.sender,
093:             _token,
094:             wantedToken,
095:             address(this),
096:             _amount,
097:             ratio
098:         );
099: 
100:         // TRANSFER TOKENS TO THE BUY ORDER
101:         SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
102:             IERC20(_token),
103:             msg.sender,
104:             address(_createdBuyOrder),
105:             _amount
106:         );
```

### Impact

Medium. Core contract functionality (Buy Order/Limit Order) is broken.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If the input token is `TaxTokensReceipt` receipt NFT, use the ERC721's transfer instead.
