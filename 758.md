# Race Condition at Loan Deadline Creates Temporary DOS

### Summary

The DebitaV3Loan contract contains inconsistent deadline checks between `payDebt` and `claimCollateralAsLender` functions, creating a race condition at the exact deadline timestamp where neither borrower nor lender can interact with the loan.

### Root Cause

In [`payDebt`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L186) function of DebitaV3loan contract:
```solidity
require(nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp, "Deadline passed to pay Debt");
```
 In [claimCollateralAsLender](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L340) function:
```solidity
require(_nextDeadline < block.timestamp && _nextDeadline != 0, "Deadline not passed");
```

Inconsistent deadline comparison operators
-  `>=`  in payDebt prevents payment at exact deadline
- `<` in claimCollateralAsLender prevents claim at exact deadline
No clear specification of who should have priority at deadline

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

When block.timestamp == nextDeadline():
- Borrower's payment reverts because nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp fails
- Lender's claim reverts because _nextDeadline < block.timestamp fails

Loan enters temporary deadlock:
- Temporary denial of service at exact deadline timestamp.
- Neither borrower can repay nor lender can claim collateral
- Affects core loan functionality at critical moment

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
// Option 1: Give borrower priority at deadline


function payDebt() {
    require(nextDeadline() > block.timestamp, "Deadline passed");
}

function claimCollateralAsLender() {
    require(_nextDeadline <= block.timestamp, "Deadline not passed");
}

// Option 2: Give lender priority at deadline
function payDebt() {
    require(nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp, "Deadline passed");
}

function claimCollateralAsLender() {
    require(_nextDeadline <= block.timestamp, "Deadline not passed");
}
```
