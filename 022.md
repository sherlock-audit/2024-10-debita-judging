# wrong implement of "deleteBorrowOrder"

### Summary

 in the deleteBorrowOrder lets say that our activeOrdersCount is 1 and we want to delete it so,
our index is 0 as borrowOrderIndex[_borrowOrder] is 0 as its first  borrower.

  allActiveBorrowOrders[0] = address(0);

    borrowOrderIndex[address(0)] = 0;

so after removal and lets suppose we createBorrowOrder a new borrower and activeOrdersCount becomes 1.
now we call again the deleteBorrowOrder with the original _borrowOrder,

but   due to activeOrdersCount is one then  allActiveBorrowOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

this will cause a new "borrower"  allActiveBorrowOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] to zero address.
this will cause a wrong implement of getActiveBorrowOrders.





function deleteBorrowOrder(address _borrowOrder) external onlyBorrowOrder {
        // get index of the borrow order
        uint index = borrowOrderIndex[_borrowOrder];
        borrowOrderIndex[_borrowOrder] = 0;

        // get last borrow order
        allActiveBorrowOrders[index] = allActiveBorrowOrders[
            activeOrdersCount - 1
        ];
        // take out last borrow order
        allActiveBorrowOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

        // switch index of the last borrow order to the deleted borrow order
        borrowOrderIndex[allActiveBorrowOrders[index]] = index;
        activeOrdersCount--;
    }



  function getActiveBorrowOrders(
        uint offset,
        uint limit
    ) external view returns (DBOImplementation.BorrowInfo[] memory) {
        uint length = limit;
        if (limit > activeOrdersCount) {
            length = activeOrdersCount;
        }
        // chequear esto
        DBOImplementation.BorrowInfo[]
            memory result = new DBOImplementation.BorrowInfo[](length - offset);
        for (uint i = 0; (i + offset) < length; i++) {
            address order = allActiveBorrowOrders[offset + i];

            DBOImplementation.BorrowInfo memory borrowInfo = DBOImplementation(
                order
            ).getBorrowInfo();
            result[i] = borrowInfo;
        }
        return result;
    }

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L162

wrong implement of deleteBorrowOrder.as we can delete the new borrower as there is no check for the  old borrower.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

the new borrower can be deleted with the old _borrowOrder.this will cause a  new borrower to be deleted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

creating a mapping that we cannot call   deleteBorrowOrder with the same _borrowOrder again and again to delete.
