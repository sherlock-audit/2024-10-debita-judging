# repay wont work

### Summary

when borrowers call repay to repay their loan back the function first sets the loan status to paid =true then it checks if the loan is already paid and if so the function reverts however due how the function is designed the check will always revert 

            // change the offer to paid on storage
            loanData._acceptedOffers[index].paid = true;


            // check if it has been already paid
            require(offer.paid == false, "Already paid");

here we can see it sets the loan status paid= true then the require checks 
offer.paid == false



### Root Cause

the function changes the status of the loan to paid and then checks if the loan is not already paid which will be true because of this line of code   loanData._acceptedOffers[index].paid = true;
