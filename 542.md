### Attack Path

Following is the information about `MixOracle` extracted from the [Debita's documentation](https://debita-finance.gitbook.io/debita-v3/lending/oracles) for context:

> To integrate a token without a direct oracle, a mix oracle is utilized. This oracle uses a TWAP oracle to compute the conversion rate between Token A and Token B. Token B must be supported on PYTH oracle, and the pricing pool should have substantial liquidity to ensure security.
>
> This approach enables us to obtain the USD valuation of tokens that would otherwise would be impossible.

In order for `MixOracle` to work, the Pyth oracle must exist on the chain.

Per the [Contest README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3-xiaoming9090?tab=readme-ov-file#q-on-what-chains-are-the-smart-contracts-going-to-be-deployed), the following chains are supported:

```solidity
Q: On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
Sonic (Prev. Fantom), Base, Arbitrum & OP
```

However, it was found that the Pyth oracle was not supported on Base chain (last checked on Nov 23 during the audit contest period). Thus, the `MixOracle` is broken on Base chain.

Pyth:

- Fantom - Supported
- Base - Not supported as of 23 Nov (only available for Base Sepolia (testnet) and not available on Mainnet)
- Arbitrum - Supported
- Optimism - Supported

### Impact

Medium. Breaks core contract functionality. Oracle is a core feature in a protocol.
