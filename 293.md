# Failure to Burn lenderID After Debt is Claimed in LendOffer Protocol

### Summary

In the payDebt function in the DebitaV3Loan contract, when the loan offer is a perpetual , and the owner of the lendOffer matches the currentOwnerOfOffer (i.e the current older of the lenderID),
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L233
 both the principal and interest are correctly sent to the lendOffer contract, marking the debt as claimed. The protocol also updates offer.debtClaimed to true. However, it neglects to call the burn function on the ownershipContract to destroy the associated lenderID. This omission results in an orphaned lenderID, leading to inconsistencies in ownership records and potential misuse.

### Root Cause

The ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID) function is not invoked when a debt is successfully claimed and offer.debtClaimed is set to true.
This oversight leaves the lenderID in existence, which should no longer represent a valid loan after the debt is claimed.

### Internal pre-conditions

The payDebt() function is called, and the conditions lendInfo.perpetual and lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer evaluate to true.

The protocol correctly transfers the principal and interest to the lender.

### External pre-conditions

call the payDebt() function

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Ownership Inconsistency: The protocol's ownership records will not reflect the true state of repaid debts.

Exploitation Risk: The unburned lenderID could be exploited for unauthorized benefits.

### PoC

Add Missing Burn Logic: Include the below line within the above code
ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID);
