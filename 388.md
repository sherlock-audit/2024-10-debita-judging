# Nobody can buy the `TaxTokenReceipt` NFT from auction

### Summary

Nobody can buy the `TaxTokenReceipt` NFT from auction due to the overrided `transferFrom` function. The `transferFrom` function is overrided with the following checks:
```javascript
function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public virtual override(ERC721, IERC721) {
        bool isReceiverAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(to) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(to) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(to);
        bool isSenderAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(from) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(from) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(from);
        // Debita not involved --> revert
        require(
            isReceiverAddressDebita || isSenderAddressDebita,
            "TaxTokensReceipts: Debita not involved"
        );
```
This ensures that the transfer of the NFT, will go smoothly through the system, but one thing is missing. The thing is that if a borrower doesn't pay off his debt amount and the loan is auctioned, nobody will be able to buy the NFT off. This is because the `transferFrom` function requires for the `from` and `to` addresses to be either a `BorrowOrder`, `LendOrder` or a `Loan` to be able to transfer the receipt NFT. At the point when the NFT is in the `Auction` contract it will be too late because neither the `Auction` contract nor the `msg.sender` is or can be one of the listed. This means that it is impossible to get any amount of collateral token out of the NFT, which means that the lenders will experience a big loss of funds

### Root Cause

The modifications of the `ERC721::transferFrom` function

### Internal pre-conditions

TaxTokenReceipt being used as loan collateral 

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User makes `BorrowOrder` with `TaxTokenReceipt` NFT as collateral
2. The offer is matched and a loan is now created.
3. Borrower doesn't pay his loan off
4. Loan is auctioned and the NFT is transferred to the created auction (Up to this moment everything is going smoothly because at least one address in the sequence meets the criteria of being either a `BorrowOrder`, `LoanOrder` or a `Loan`)
5. At this point there is no eligible address  since the `Auction` address doesn't meet the criteria and the `msg.sender` is just unable to meet it since neither the `BorrowOrder` nor the `LendOrder` can call [`Auction::buyNFT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L109-L161) function.

### Impact

Lenders will experience big loss of funds, since the NFT can't be sold. Borrower will go off with their principle token and money that they should get in the form of NFT underlying are frozen forever. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check to the `TaxTokenReceipt` NFT that ensures that an auction is active (Has an index different than 0 in the `auctionFactoryDebita::AuctionOrderIndex` mapping) and it is part of the `Debita` system (as it is indeed part of the system)
