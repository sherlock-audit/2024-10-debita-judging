# Order Count Desynchronization via Cancel-and-Reactivate

### Summary

The [deleteOrder function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L162-L177) for `DLOImplementation` doesnt explicity check if an order has been deleted before, when a lender cancel an offer and decide to add fund again, then cancel, causing a mismatch between the actual number of active orders and activeOrdersCount, potentially leading to order collisions and state corruption.

### Root Cause

The deleteOrder function in the factory contract decrements [activeOrdersCount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L176) without checking if the order was already cancelled, allowing multiple cancellations of the same order to artificially decrease the counter.


### Impact

- The activeOrdersCount becomes desynchronized from the actual number of active orders
- Future order creations might overwrite existing orders due to incorrect indexing
- The system's state becomes corrupted, potentially leading to lost funds or inaccessible orders

### PoC

Initial State:

Let's say we have 3 active lending orders `(Order0, Order1, Order2)`
activeOrdersCount = 4
Order0 is at index 0, Order1 at index 1, Order2 at index 2

Attack Scenario:

Step 1: User has Order1

User calls [cancelOffer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L144) on Order1
This triggers deleteOrder() in the factory
activeOrdersCount decrements to 2
Order2 gets moved to Order1's position (index 1)
Order1's isLendOrderLegit remains true (bug: never set to false)


Step 2: Re-adding Funds

User calls [addFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162) on the cancelled Order1
Since isLendOrderLegit was never set to false, the order is still considered legitimate
The funds are added back, but the order count remains decremented


Result of Collision:

User repeats this over again until the protocol becomes unuseable.

### Mitigation

There should be proper checks to ensure the protocol works as expected.
