# Incorrect feeOfMaxDeadline calculation in extendLoan

### Summary

The feeOfMaxDeadline's calculation is incorrect. This may cause the borrowers pay more fees than expected.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Loan:extendLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L602), borrowers can extend their loan. We will calculate `feeOfMaxDeadline`, and then calculate the extra fees(`misingBorrowFee`) that the borrowers need to pay.
The borrow fee's formula is `borrow duration * feePerDay/ 86400`. But we use the `offer.maxDeadline` not the duration in ` uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /86400);`. This may cause that borrowers may pay more fees than expected.
```solidity
        uint PorcentageOfFeePaid = ((m_loan.initialDuration * feePerDay) /
            86400);
        // adjust fees

        if (PorcentageOfFeePaid > maxFee) {
            PorcentageOfFeePaid = maxFee;
        } else if (PorcentageOfFeePaid < minFEE) {
            PorcentageOfFeePaid = minFEE;
        }
        if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
                    // calculate difference from fee paid for the initialDuration vs the extra fee they should pay because of the extras days of extending the loan.  MAXFEE shouldnt be higher than extra fee + PorcentageOfFeePaid
@>            uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /
                 86400);
            if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
                feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
            } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) {
                feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
            }
            misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
      }
```
