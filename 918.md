# NFT will be locked in buyOrder

### Summary

Caller of `sellNFT` will sell his NFT in exchange of some collateral amount. Collateral will be transfered to seller of NFT, but the NFT will be transfered to `address(this)`, not owner of `BuyOrder.sol`, and `BuyOrder.sol` has no way to withdraw/recover locked NFT.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L99-L103)

Neither `BuyOrder()` nor `buyOrderFactory` does not have any way for `buyInformation.owner` to withdraw his NFT after seller sold it to him.

### Internal pre-conditions

Buyer creates an order for some amount of ERC20 collateral in exchange for an NFT.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

- Seller calls `sellNFT()`;
- Collateral will be transfered to seller, the NFT will be transfered to `address(this)`;
- NFT is locked in `buyOrder()` forever.

### Impact

Buyer of NFT will lose his collateral and will not receive NFT in exchange.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
-           address(this),
+           buyInformation.owner,
            receiptID
        );
```
