# Incorrect minimum fee is used to adjust the loan fee, which may prevent the borrower from extending the loan.

### Summary

The borrower is charged a daily interest rate of 0.04% (`feePerDay`) on the borrowed amount, with a minimum rate of 0.2% (`minFEE`) and a maximum rate of 0.8% (`maxFee`). If the fee is less than `minFEE`, it should be adjusted to the `minFEE`. However in `DebitaV3Loan.sol:606`, to determine if `feeOfMaxDeadline` needs to be adjusted to the minimum fee, it compares `feeOfMaxDeadline` with `feePerDay`, whereas it should actually be compared with `minFEE`. If the max duration of the lend offer is less than 5 days (`0.04% * 5 days = 0.2%`), the `extendLoan` will revert, as it will underflow at `DebitaV3Loan.sol:610` (`feeOfMaxDeadline < PorcentageOfFeePaid = minFEE`).
```solidity
        uint PorcentageOfFeePaid = ((m_loan.initialDuration * feePerDay) /
            86400);
        // adjust fees

        if (PorcentageOfFeePaid > maxFee) {
            PorcentageOfFeePaid = maxFee;
577:    } else if (PorcentageOfFeePaid < minFEE) {
578:        PorcentageOfFeePaid = minFEE;
        }

...

                if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
                    // calculate difference from fee paid for the initialDuration vs the extra fee they should pay because of the extras days of extending the loan.  MAXFEE shouldnt be higher than extra fee + PorcentageOfFeePaid
                    uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /
                        86400);
                    if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
                        feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
606:                } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) {
                        feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
                    }

610:                misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
                }

### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan.sol:606-607`, `feePerDay` is used as the minimum fee to adjust the `feeOfMaxDeadline`, while in fact, it should be `minFEE`.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. There exists an unpaid lend offer with a max duration less than 5 days in the loan.
2. The borrower calls `extendLoan`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The borrower will unable to extend the loan if there exists an unpaid lend offer with a max duration less than 5 days.


### PoC

_No response_
