# Lack of NFT Retrieval Mechanism in the sellNFT Function

### Summary

The sellNFT function transfers the NFT from the seller to the BuyOrder contract but lacks a mechanism for the owner of the BuyOrder contract to retrieve the NFT. This could result in NFTs being permanently locked in the contract.

### Root Cause

BuyOrder contract implements sellNFT function to transfer NFTs from sellers to the contract, but lacks a corresponding claim function for the buy order owner to retrieve these NFTs. This results in NFTs being permanently locked in the contract.

```solidity
    function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
        require(buyInformation.isActive, "Buy order is not active");
        require(
            buyInformation.availableAmount > 0,
            "Buy order is not available"
        );

        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            receiptID
        );
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A buy order is created by an owner
2. The buy order has sufficient funds to purchase NFTs
3. A seller successfully calls sellNFT to sell their NFT to the buy order


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The buy order owner suffers permanent loss of purchased NFTs as they remain locked in the contract. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Option 1: Transfer NFT Directly to the Owner
```solidity
IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
    msg.sender,
    buyInformation.owner,
    receiptID
);
```
Option 2: Add a Claim Function
Introduce a claimNFT function to allow the buyInformation.owner to retrieve NFTs stored in the BuyOrder contract.
