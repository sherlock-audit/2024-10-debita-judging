# Improper contract ownership transfer mechanism could lead to a loss of control over key protocol components

### Summary

The ownership of contracts `DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol` and `AuctionFactory.sol` is changed without doing some key necessary checks.

This could lead to a loss of control over these two contracts.

### Root Cause

The ownership of the smart contract is transferred to another address without doing 

- a zero check, and
- a verification of the new address

This happens in two contracts.

First is in `DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol` at [L111](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol#L111)

```solidity
    function transferOwnership(address _newAddress) public onlyOwner {
        admin = _newAddress;
    }
```

Second is in `AuctionFactory.sol` at [L221](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L221)

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If by mistake, the address is set to a zero address, then the control of the contract is lost forever

And if it is set to an unintended address, then control of the contract maybe lost forever (unless it's an address already known to the owner)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Before transferring the ownership of a contract:

- Add a zero address check
- Add a two step verification mechanism (like OpenZeppelin's [Ownable2Step](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/access#Ownable2Step)) to make sure that the ownership is being transferred to the intended address only.
