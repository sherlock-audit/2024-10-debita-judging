# ClaimDebt function fails to update storage for interestToClaim

## Summary

Using a memory copy of `loanData._acceptedOffers[index]` instead of directly accessing storage will cause `interestToClaim` to not be updated to 0, allowing an attacker to call `claimDebt` multiple times and repeatedly claim the same debt and interest, leading to unauthorized gains.

## Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan.sol:_claimDebt`, the use of a memory copy for `loanData._acceptedOffers[index]` causes `interestToClaim` to not be updated to 0 in storage, allowing repeated claims on the same debt and interest.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L292-L302

## Attack Path

1. **Lender calls `claimDebt`**:
   - A lender calls `claimDebt` with the index of an offer that has already been paid (`offer.paid == true`).

2. **Function calls `_claimDebt`**:
   - Inside `_claimDebt`, the `offer` struct is loaded into memory.

3. **Interest is not updated in storage**:
   - The line `offer.interestToClaim = 0;` only updates the memory copy, leaving the actual `loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim` in storage unchanged.

4. **Debt and interest are transferred to the lender**:
   - The lender successfully receives both the principal and the interest.

5. **Lender repeats the process**:
   - Since `interestToClaim` in storage is not set to 0, the lender can repeatedly call `claimDebt` and `_claimDebt`, collecting the same interest and principal multiple times.

## Impact

The **protocol and lenders** suffer an approximate loss equal to the total `interestToClaim` and `principleAmount` of the loan repeatedly, as the attacker can call `claimDebt` multiple times to drain funds. The attacker gains these amounts each time they exploit the vulnerability.

## Mitigation

### Mitigation

```diff
function _claimDebt(uint index) internal {
    LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
    IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);

    infoOfOffers memory offer = m_loan._acceptedOffers[index];
    require(
        ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) == msg.sender,
        "Not lender"
    );
    require(offer.paid == true, "Not paid");
    require(offer.debtClaimed == false, "Already claimed");

    // Mark debt as claimed
    loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;

    // Burn the ownership token
    ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID);

    // Load interest and principal from storage
    uint interest = loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim;

    // Reset interest to zero in storage
+    loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim = 0;

    // Transfer the interest and principal to the lender
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
        IERC20(offer.principle),
        msg.sender,
        interest + offer.principleAmount
    );

    Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));
}
```
