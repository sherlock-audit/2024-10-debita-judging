# Confidence Intervals of Pyth Network's Prices Are Ignored

### Summary

The ``DebitaPyth.sol`` contract utilizes the Pyth Netowrk for fetching prices. However as can be seen from the [DebitaPyth::getThePrice(()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaPyth.sol#L25-L41) function:
```solidity
    function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        bytes32 _priceFeed = priceIdPerToken[tokenAddress];
        require(_priceFeed != bytes32(0), "Price feed not set");
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");

        // Get the price from the pyth contract, no older than 90 seconds
        PythStructs.Price memory priceData = pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan(
            _priceFeed,
            600
        );

        // Check if the price feed is available and the price is valid
        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(priceData.price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return priceData.price;
    }
```
the protocol completely ignores the confidence interval provided by the price feed. The prices fetched by the Pyth network come with a degree of uncertainty which is expressed as a confidence interval around the given price values. Considering a provided price `p`, its confidence interval `σ` is roughly the standard deviation of the price's probability distribution. The [official documentation of the Pyth Price Feeds](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals) recommends some ways in which this confidence interval can be utilized for enhanced security. For example, the protocol can compute the value `σ / p` to decide the level of the price's uncertainty and disallow user interaction with the system in case this value exceeds some threshold. Keep in mind that borrowers and lenders may use different oracles(Chainlink, Pyth, Custom oracle), or rely on ratios for setting the amount of tokens they would like to lend/borrow. If one of the parties relies on uncertain prices, this may result in a loss for said party. 

### Root Cause

In the the [DebitaPyth::getThePrice(()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaPyth.sol#L25-L41) function the protocol completely ignores the confidence interval provided by the price feed.

### Attack Path

### Impact

A borrow or a lender who uses the Pyth Network as a source of price, and LTVs in order to determine the ratio at which he would like to borrow/lend tokens, in the case of invalid prices he may be a at a loss depending on whether the invalid price is unfavorable to his position. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider utilizing the confidence interval provided by the Pyth price feed as recommended in the official documentation. This would help mitigate the possibility of users taking advantage of invalid prices.
