# Deleted Lend Orders Remain Legitimate Due to `isLendOrderLegit` Not Being Updated

### Summary

The failure to update the `isLendOrderLegit` mapping after deleting a lend order in the `deleteOrder` function causes potential unauthorized actions for the protocol, as attackers can exploit deleted lend orders that are still considered legitimate. This oversight allows a deleted lend order to continue performing actions restricted to legitimate lend orders, potentially leading to state corruption and security breaches.

### Root Cause

In `DLOFactory.sol:104`, the `deleteOrder` function {https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207C4-L220C6} does not update the `isLendOrderLegit` mapping to reflect that the lend order has been deleted. As a result, the lend order remains marked as legitimate (`isLendOrderLegit[_lendOrder]` remains `true`) even after it has been removed from the active orders.
```solidity
// DLOFactory.sol:104
function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder {
    uint index = LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder];
    LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder] = 0;

   // audit doesnt update isLendOrderLegit to false

    // Switch index of the last lend order to the deleted lend order
    allActiveLendOrders[index] = allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1];
    LendOrderIndex[allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]] = index;

    // Remove the last lend order
    allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

    activeOrdersCount--;
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. At least one lend order in the system.

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions required.

### Attack Path

1. A legitimate lend order (LendOrder) is deleted using the `deleteOrder` function.
Due to the missing update, isLendOrderLegit[LendOrder] remains true.
2. That LendOrder can access functions protected by `onlyLendOrder`.

### Impact

 - Deleted lend orders can continue to interact with the protocol as if they were legitimate.
 - This can lead to unauthorized updates, deletions, or other harmful actions.
 - For example, calling deleteOrder multiple times can cause `activeOrdersCount` to underflow.

### PoC

No PoC.

### Mitigation

Update `deleteOrder` (plus *issue#1* + *issue#2*):

```solidity
function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder {
... rest of code

 // Mark the lend order as no longer legitimate
    isLendOrderLegit[_lendOrder] = false;

... rest of code
```
