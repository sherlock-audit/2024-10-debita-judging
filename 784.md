# Missing ownershipNFT to loanId Mapping Hinders Loan Validation and Ownership Transfers





### Summary

When orders are matched , ownership of the created loan is represented via `NFT` and are minted to the `lenders` and the `borrower`.This allows the owners to transfer their ownership of their corresponding NFT/Loan responsibility to other users who is willing to accept it. 
It has been implemented correctly for `lenders`.

But, due to the missing `borrowerNFTId` -> `loanId` mapping , the users  find it impractical to validate the loan and hence avoid accepting those ownerships.

This lack of transparency makes it impractical for users to accept the ownership of the borrower’s NFT.

The functionalaity of the `DebitaLoanOwnerships` Contract where these `NFTs` are minted and transferred is broken and partially rendered useless.


### Root Cause

In case of Lender, we have  getLoanIdByOwnershipID[lendID] = loanID; where lendId is NFTId of the ownership of the lender.

```solidity
            uint lendID = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract).mint(lendInfo.owner);
            offers[i] = DebitaV3Loan.infoOfOffers({
                ....
            });
            getLoanIdByOwnershipID[lendID] = loanID;
            lenders[i] = lendInfo.owner;
```

But in case of borrowID, protocol fails to point borrowID to the loanId.

```solidity
        uint borrowID = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract).mint(borrowInfo.owner);
```
