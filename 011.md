# `DebitaV3Aggregator::changeOwner` Function Fails to Update Ownership Due to Parameter Shadowing

### Summary

The `changeOwner` function in `DebitaV3Aggregator` and `AuctionFactory` fails to correctly update ownership because the `owner` parameter shadows the contract’s state variable `owner`. This causes the `require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner")` check to compare `msg.sender` to the parameter `owner`, rather than the actual state variable. As a result:

- The function will always revert if the provided address is different from the caller’s address.

- The function does not revert if the caller passes their own address as the new owner, but the transaction becomes a no-op — no state changes are made because the state variable is not updated.

These issues prevent the rightful owner from updating the ownership and allow unauthorized users to call the function without effect.

```solidity
address public owner;

function changeOwner(address owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    // @> comparison against the parameter, not the storage variable
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner;
    // @> no-op we are updating the parameter instead of the storage variable
}
```

### Root Cause

In [https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682) the `owner` parameter shadows the storage variable with the same name.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The rightful owner calls the `changeOwner` function passing a new owner address.

### Impact

These issue prevents the rightful owner from updating the ownership and allows unauthorized users to call the function without effect.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


To avoid the conflict between the parameter and the state variable `owner`, either rename the parameter to `newOwner` or eliminate the custom `changeOwner` function and use OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` library, which provides a secure and tested way to manage ownership.

Option 1: **Rename the parameter**:

```diff
address public owner;

- function changeOwner(address owner) public {
+ function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
-   owner = owner;
+   owner = newOwner;  // Assign the new owner to the state variable
}
```
