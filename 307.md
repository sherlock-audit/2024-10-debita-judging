# When extending a loan `missingBorrowFee` will always be larger than it should be due to incorrect implementation

### Summary

Due to incorrect fee calculation in `extendLoan()` function the borrower that initially paid less than `maxFee` will pay `maxFee - PercentageOfFeePaid` for the extended loan duration *REGARDLESS* of whether the new loan duration should result in `maxFee` threshold being met. 

### Root Cause

When `feeOfMaxDeadline` is calculated:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L602
the resulting value will be extremely large because `offer.maxDeadline` is a value set to `lendInfo.maxDuration + block.timestamp` in `matchOffersV3()`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L511
And therefore the following condition will always be met:

### Internal pre-conditions

- valid loan is created with initial duration of < 20 days 
- the borrower decides to extend the loan after 10% of the loan duration

### Impact

Borrowers will have to pay more fees than they should when extending a loan, leading to significant loss of funds ( > 0.01% and > 10$ ). 

Assume that the initial duration was 5 days and the borrower paid `0.2%` fee. After 1 day they decided to extend the loan. The max loan duration for the complementary lend order was 7 days ( lonely lend order for simplicity ). The borrower expects to pay an extra `0.08%` fee for the additional two days ( `feePerDay * 2` ). Instead, they pay `0.6%`  ( `0.8% - 0.2%` ). 

Sherlock's medium severity issue criteria:
A relevant loss is said to be a user's loss of more than 0.01% and 10 USD of principal. As illustrated above it's easy for this issue to cause a loss of `0.52%` of principal (0.6%-0.08%), for which to be more than 10 USD the loan has to be for ~1923 USD of value in the given principal (10/0.0072) - practical amount for a loan. 

### PoC

It can be provided if required to prove medium severity. The `maxDeadline` is clearly not meant to be used for this calculation so the PoC for that seems unnecessary. 

### Mitigation

Consider utilizing `extendedTime` variable ( which is currently unused ) to calculate the missing borrow fee that has to be paid directly: 
```diff
- uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) / 86400);
+ uint missingBorrowFee = ((extendTime * feePerDay) / 86400);
```
and then add `missingBorrowFee` to `PorcentageOfFeePaid` and ensure it's not larger than `maxFee` - if this sum would be smaller than `minFee` then `missingBorrowFee` should be 0 - the borrower already paid 0.2% in `matchOffersV3()`.
