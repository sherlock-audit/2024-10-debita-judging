# Griefing Attack Through Fake Orders and Lack of Ownership Validation in Buy Orders

### Summary

The `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol` allows attackers to create fake orders with arbitrary token addresses, including those that may not exist. Additionally, there are no checks to ensure that a buy order for the same NFT is created by the same owner. This opens the system to abuse, griefing, and operational inefficiencies.

### Root Cause

There is no check in the borrow order contracts to verify if the collateral is a vaild collateral or not This allows attackers to create orders with invalid or non-existent token addresses.
Multiple buy orders can be created for the same NFT without validating if the buyer already has a claim or right to it.

### Impact

Attackers can create multiple fake orders with non-existent tokens, bloating the system and creating confusion.
These orders waste storage and computational resources, affecting legitimate users.
Multiple buy orders for the same NFT can lead to collisions or overwrites, making the auctioning process unreliable.
The attacker can fill the system with orders that will never resolve, effectively locking out legitimate users from efficiently participating.
