# Exploit to Double Earn via Short Loan Duration and Immediate Auction Listing

### Summary

The protocol allows a malicious actor to exploit short loan durations and immediately list collateral for auction.

 This enables the attacker to simultaneously profit from both the loan amount and the proceeds of the auctioned collateral.

### Root Cause

The protocol does not implement sufficient restrictions or validations to prevent collateral from being auctioned immediately after a loan is matched and the collateral is transferred. Additionally, borrowers have control over the loan duration, which they can set to extremely short periods, further facilitating the exploit.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

	1.	Double Earnings for Attacker: The malicious user effectively earns the loan amount as well as the auction proceeds for the same collateral.
	2.	Loss of Trust: This exploit undermines the integrity of the protocol, leading to potential loss of trust among legitimate users.
	3.	Financial Loss to Lenders: Lenders are left with insufficient collateral or unrecoverable funds, as the collateral is liquidated prematurely.

### PoC

1.	Setup Phase:
	•	The attacker creates both a borrowing offer (with collateral) and a matching lending offer.
2.	Exploitation:
	•	The attacker matches their own offers (or finds a matching lender) with an extremely short loan duration.
	•	The collateral is transferred to the loan contract as part of the loan process.
3.	Auction Manipulation:
	•	Immediately after the loan is created, the attacker lists the collateral for auction.
	•	The auction completes before the loan duration expires, allowing the attacker to collect the proceeds.
4.	Outcome:
	•	The attacker earns:
	•	The loan amount.
	•	The auction proceeds from the collateral.
	•	The lender receives nothing if the loan is defaulted, as the collateral has already been sold.

### Mitigation

1.	Restrict Immediate Auction Listing:
	•	Enforce a minimum lock period for collateral before it can be listed for auction.
2.	Loan Duration Validation:
	•	Set a minimum loan duration to prevent the creation of extremely short-term loans.
3.	Auction Restrictions:
	•	Ensure that collateral tied to an active loan cannot be listed for auction until the loan is repaid or defaulted legitimately.
4.	Monitoring and Alerts:
	•	Implement monitoring mechanisms to detect and flag unusual patterns such as repeated short-term loans and immediate auction listings by the same user.
