# Incentive Tokens Stuck in Contract

### Summary

If there is no lend or borrow activity for the incentivized pair in the same epoch, the incentive tokens remain stuck in the contract. The incentive contract does not provide a mechanism to claim these tokens, resulting in a permanent lockup of incentives that cannot be recovered.



### Root Cause

The `incentivizePair` function allows any user to provide incentive tokens for lending or borrowing activities in future epochs. However, if no lending or borrowing activity occurs during the incentivized epoch, these tokens become permanently locked in the contract as there is no mechanism to recover or withdraw unused incentives.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to incentivize lend or borrow pairs
2. No lending or borrowing activity occurs during epoch 
3. The incentive remains locked in the contract permanently


### External pre-conditions
