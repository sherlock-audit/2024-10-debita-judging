# LimitOrders cannot be updated on `DutchAuction_veNFT`

### Summary

Auctions where the starting price is equal to the floor price are called limitOrders. Sellers sell at a fixed price.

The protocol allows for this case and when creating an auction does not indicate that initAmount is strictly more floorAmount.
```solidity
require(_initAmount >= _floorAmount, "Invalid amount");
```
When creating such auctions, their tickPerBlock value becomes 0.
```solidity
uint curedInitAmount = _initAmount * (10 ** difference);
uint curedFloorAmount = _floorAmount * (10 ** difference);
s_CurrentAuction = dutchAuction_INFO({
            auctionAddress: address(this),
            nftAddress: _veNFTAddress,
            nftCollateralID: _veNFTID,
            sellingToken: sellingToken,
            owner: owner,
            initAmount: curedInitAmount,
            floorAmount: curedFloorAmount,
            duration: _duration,
            endBlock: block.timestamp + _duration,
            tickPerBlock: (curedInitAmount - curedFloorAmount) / _duration,
            isActive: true,
            initialBlock: block.timestamp,
            isLiquidation: _isLiquidation,
            differenceDecimals: difference
        });
```

However, in the editFloorPrice function that allows to reduce floor price auction - newDuration is [calculated by dividing on tickPerBlock](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L203). Thus, for limit orders this operation will always be panic revert. So editFloorPrice does not work for limitOrders.

### Root Cause

`DutchAuction_veNFT::editFloorPrice` does not check that tickPerBlock can be 0, although it can be.

### Internal pre-conditions

1) User creates limitOrder with initAmount = floorAmount
2) User want to edit floor price

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Broken functional of contract for some cases. Severity - medium.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add extra logic for handle limitOrders price editing on Auction.
