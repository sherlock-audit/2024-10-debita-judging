# Owner of managed veAERO will steal all the collateral to lenders

### Summary

The owner of a managed veAERO can create a loan using that veNFT as collateral and steal it at any point in time, leaving lenders without collateral when the loan defaults.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that the `veNFTAerodrome` contract allows depositing managed veAERO, which has a different behavior than normal veAERO.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The owner of the managed veAERO NFT has to open a loan using that managed veAERO as collateral.

### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker must obtain managed veAERO. Currently, this can be done by requesting one directly to the Aerodrome protocol.

These managed veAERO NFTs are called Relays on the Aerodrome front end. The website states the following about those:
> Partner protocols can request a Relay strategy, this will soon require an open governance proposal to be voted and passed by the veAERO voters.

Currently, there are more than 45 of these Relays so any of those can execute this attack and steal a great amount of funds from lenders within Debita. Also, an attacker could get one from Aerodrome and then execute this attack in Debita. 

### Attack Path

1. The attacker gets one managed veAERO (Relay), or it already has one
2. The attacker then creates a normal veAERO token with a ton of funds and deposits into that Relay (`Voter::depositManaged`), so the locked amount of AERO on the Relay is now really high.
3. The attacker locks that Relay in [`veNFTAerodrome`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/Receipt-veNFT.sol#L63-L111) and gets a `veNFTVault`, which uses as collateral for a loan.
4. When the loan is open and the attacker has received the loaned funds, it uses the normal veAERO and withdraws the delegated amount to the Relay (`Voter::withdrawManaged`). 
5. Time passes and the loan defaults.
6. When the lenders want to claim the collateral, the locked amount of AERO within the Relay will be 0, meaning the collateral left in the loan will be worthless. 

### Impact

An attacker can open a big loan using a managed veAERO (Relay) as collateral and then steal all that collateral from the lenders. This is a direct and significant loss of funds for lenders, hence the high severity. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, do not allow depositing managed veAERO (Relay) into `veNFTAerodrome` so they cannot be used as collateral.
