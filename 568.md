# If no borrow and lend orders are matched during an epoch, the rewards for that epoch will be locked in the contract forever

### Summary

The ``DebitaIncentives.sol`` contract allows users to incentivize other users to create borrow and lend orders for certain principles. They can do that by calling the [incentivizePair()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L225-L294) function and transfer the incentive token into the ``DebitaIncentives.sol`` contract. However if there are no borrow and lend orders that are matched for a specific principle that has been incentivized for a certain epoch, the incentives tokens transferred into the ``DebitaIncentives.sol`` contract will be locked forever, and they can't be utilized as incentives for an up and coming epoch. This essentially results in the users who are incentivizing for a specific principal token loosing the tokens they deposited as incentives, and not accomplishing their goal of making borrowers and lenders create orders for the specific principal. 

### Root Cause

In the ``DebitaIncentives.sol`` contract, there is no functionality that allows users who deposited incentives tokens for a specific principal token and an epoch, to either withdraw or utilize the already deposited(but not utilized) incentive tokens in a future epoch, in a scenario where no borrow and lend orders were matched for the specific principal during the epoch.
