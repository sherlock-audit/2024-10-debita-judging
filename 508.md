# Some ERC20 will revert when transfer zero value on fees for `feeAddress`

## Summary

Sometimes  calculating fee for `feeAddress`, `feeAmount` will be equal `0`, So for any token that doesn't support transfer zero value, it will revert. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When creating an Auction, a user can set a token for payment whatever they want. Logically, it's never impact to the protocol. But if we see at the codebase which calculating fee, it's possible to get zero amount. 
 Let's see code below : 
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L124-L140
 
 Let's create a scenario : 
 1. At the worst case, protocol has 0.05% fee for `feeAddress`
 2. `fee = 50` and denominator = `10_000`
 3. Let's say the price is `200`
 4. `feeAmount` = `(200 * 50) / 10_000`
 5. `feeAmount = 1`
 6. Since the price is equal or more higher than `200`, it's no problem, but the price lower than `200`, `feeAmount` will zero
 
## Recomendation

Add check for fee transfer

```diff
+  if(feeAmount > 0){
      SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom( 
           IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken), 
           msg.sender, 
           feeAddress, 
           feeAmount 
       );
+  } 
```
