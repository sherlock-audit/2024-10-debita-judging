# `_safeMint` should be used instead of `_mint`

### Summary

`_mint` is used by the protocol to mint `ERC721` tokens for borrow/lend order ownerships, as well as to deposit taxable `ERC20` tokens into the protocol. It is highly recommended that `_safeMint` be used to mint the tokens because it has an added check to ensure that `ERC721` tokens are only minted to those addresses that support them. 

### Root Cause

In various places in the code, `_mint` is used to mint ownerships of lending, and borrowing tokens. This is discouraged by [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/d11ed2fb0a0130363b1e82d5742ad7516df0e749/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L276) because `_safeMint` ensures that the tokens will only be minted to addresses that support them.

Similarly, `_mint` is used by the [`TaxTokensReceipt::deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L72) to deposit `ERC20` tokens with tax-on-transfer and be provided with an `ERC721` token to be used within the protocol. If the receiving address does not support receiving the `ERC721` token, it will be locked, and the user will lose their deposit.

### Impact

If a user deposits their Taxable ERC20 token into the `TaxTokensReceipt` contract using the `deposit` function without their wallet supporting `ERC721` tokens, they will lose the tokens completely. 

Users who's wallet do not support `ERC721` tokens will also lose their lend and borrower order ownership `ERC721` tokens.
