# Loss of tokens for users who deposit in the TaxTokensReceipt contract

### Summary

In order to integrate FoT tokens to the system the project introduces the `TaxTokensReceipt` contract, where users deposit their FoT tokens 
and in return getting minted an NFT, which represents these tokens as collateral when creating borrow orders. The problem is that due to incorrect logic the deposited tokens will be permanently stuck in the contract.

### Root Cause

The root lies in the `deposit()` function, more specifically how the `tokenAmountPerID` mapping is updated upon deposit. If we take a look: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/ce50bab1067574ae493f4062665b8e28611f2346/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L71

```javascript
function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(ERC20(tokenAddress), msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
@>      tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
        return tokenID;
    }
```

As we can see the initial `amount` is assigned to the mapping, instead of the actual amount that the contract holds, in this case it will be the `difference` variable. Now if we look at the withdraw function: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/ce50bab1067574ae493f4062665b8e28611f2346/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L83-L87

```javascript
 function withdraw(uint _tokenID) public nonReentrant {
        ...
@>      uint amount = tokenAmountPerID[_tokenID];
        tokenAmountPerID[_tokenID] = 0;
        _burn(_tokenID);

@>      SafeERC20.safeTransfer(ERC20(tokenAddress), msg.sender, amount);
        emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
The same initial `amount` is used in the transfer function, which will cause the call to revert due to insufficient balance

_No response_

### Impact

- Likelihood: High, as this will happen everytime
- Impact: High, there are few impacts:
1. First depositor will not be able to withdraw his funds until there are other depositors (until there is sufficient balance) - DoS
2. Last depositor will loose all of his deposited funds and they will be forever locked, because of the tax applied to each transfer and because of the incorrect mapping update there will always be less funds than tried to be withdrawn or lender (since he can get the collateral of the borrower in case of default) will not be able to get the collateral - Loss of funds

### PoC

Consider the following scenario:

1. User deposits `1000` FoT (let's say the fee is `10`)
2. The actual amount that the contract holds will be `990`
3. But the assigned variable to the mapping will the parameter variable (`1000`)
4. So when a user tries to withdraw it will try to transfer back the `1000` instead of the real amount `990`, which will lead to revert

### Mitigation

```diff
 function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
-       tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
+       tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = difference;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
        return tokenID;
    }
```
