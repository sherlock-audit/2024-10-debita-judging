### Attack Path

Assume that the ratio/price is 1e18 (1 XYZ per ABC => Principle per Collateral). XYZ is 18 decimals while ABC is 6 decimals.

Assume that Bob (malicious borrower) calls the permissionless `DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3` function. The amount of collateral deducted from Bob's borrow offer is calculated via the following:

```solidity
userUsedCollateral = (lendAmountPerOrder[i] * (10 ** decimalsCollateral)) / ratio;
userUsedCollateral = (lendAmountPerOrder[i] * 1e6) / 1e18;
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L467

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Aggregator.sol
274:     function matchOffersV3(
..SNIP..
466:             // calculate the amount of collateral used by the lender
467:             uint userUsedCollateral = (lendAmountPerOrder[i] *
468:                 (10 ** decimalsCollateral)) / ratio;
```


For `lendAmountPerOrder`, he uses a value that is small enough to trigger a rounding to zero error. The range of `lendAmountPerOrder` that will cause `userUsedCollateral` to round down to zero is:

$0â‰¤lendAmountPerOrder<10^{12}$

Thus, for each offer, Bob will specify the `lendAmountPerOrder[i]` to be `1e12 - 1`. Thus, for each offer, he will be able to obtain `1e12 - 1` XYZ tokens without paying a single ABC tokens as collateral.

This attack is profitable because each `matchOffersV3` transaction can execute up to 100 offers, and the protocol is intended to be deployed on L2 chains where gas fees are extremely cheap or even negligible.

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Aggregator.sol
274:     function matchOffersV3(
..SNIP..
289:         // check lendOrder length is less than 100
290:         require(lendOrders.length <= 100, "Too many lend orders");
```

### Impact

High. Loss of assets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

This issue can be easily mitigated by implementing the following changes to prevent the above attack.

```diff
// calculate the amount of collateral used by the lender
uint userUsedCollateral = (lendAmountPerOrder[i] * (10 ** decimalsCollateral)) / ratio;
+ require(userUsedCollateral > 0, "userUsedCollateral is zero")
```
