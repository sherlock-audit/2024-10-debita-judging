# Borrow Order collateral issue: previous manager of `Receipt-veNFT` still have "Manager" access to grief lender

### Summary
NFT `Receipt-veNFT.sol` has a manager address that never revoked after it was ERC721-transfer to `DebitaV3Loan.sol` or `AuctionFactory.sol` or `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol`.

The previous manager address can perform grief actions to change nature of Receipt NFT (the borrower collateral).
Causing damage to lender who accept NFT receipt collateral. (stole bribes token, extend lock 4 more years)
### Root Cause

All Receipt NFT have this manager address with permission to vote,claim,reset,extend lock on veNFT.

This manager address never changed through out Debita source code. So original manager have backdoor access.


#### More Detail on the issue

- Auction and `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol` contract use this NFT `Receipt-veNFT.sol`. This was clarified in docs and test file.
- `Receipt-veNFT.sol` wrap around `veNFTAerodrome.sol`. And `veNFTAerodrome.sol` wrap around original Voting Escrow NFT (veNFT).
- `Receipt-veNFT` take user veNFT and transfer it to new `veNFTAerodrome` vault contract.
- `veNFTAerodrome` have a fixed manager address on creation.

- Manager address is msg.sender who call `deposit()` NFT on `Receipt-veNFT.sol`.

- New owner of NFT `Receipt-veNFT.sol` can call `changeManager()` to update new ownership.
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/veNFTAerodrome.sol#L110-L123>
- Going through codebase, these contract `Auction.sol` and `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol` read NFT receipt data but never check `OwnerIsManager` is false. Or even call `changeManager()` to revoke manager.
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Equalizer/Receipt-veNFT.sol#L233>
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L126-L130>

This result in receipt NFT transfer to new user and it still have old manager address.
Manager have permission to vote,claim,reset,extend lock on veNFT.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Alice deposit veNFT with 1 year lock and 100e18 token to `Receipt-veNFT` contract.
- `veNFTAerodrome` created with Alice address as manager
- Alice list their receipt NFT for sale on `AuctionFactory` or `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory`.
### External pre-conditions


- Alice sell `Receipt-veNFT` to Bob through `AuctionFactory` or `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory`
- Bob receive their `Receipt-veNFT` after loan failed or auction ended.
- Bob never know to call `changeManager()` to update manager address.

### Attack Path


With above condition:

- Alice can grief Bob by call `Receipt-veNFT.extendMultiple()` with their receiptID. Extending escrow lock for 4 more years max
- Alice can use NFT during loan duration to vote, earn bribes token.

### Impact

Griefing attack on new owner (lender) of Receipt NFT.
Attacker can extend underlying escrow lock and use NFT receipt to vote and earn bribes token with someone else receipt.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


After reading receipt data in Loan factory, revoke manager access with current factory, loan contract.
Lender should have wrapping manager access over NFT during loan duration.
