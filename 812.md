### Root Cause

```solidity
    if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
        // calculate difference from fee paid for the initialDuration vs the extra fee they should pay because of the extras days of extending the loan.  MAXFEE shouldnt be higher than extra fee + PorcentageOfFeePaid
    =>  uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /86400); //@audit-issue incorrect fee calculation ,deadline instead of duration
        if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
            feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
        } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) { 
            feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
        }

        misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
    }
```

`offer.maxDeadline` is  the maximum timestamp lender provides for his offer to be valid.

 It is calculated by `offer.maxDeadline = lendInfo.maxDuration + block.timestamp` in DebitaV3Aggregator contract.(code)[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L511]

But protocol incorrectly assumes it as the `lendInfo.maxDuration` of that offer and use it for the fee calculation.

```solidity
    if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {

        uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline - loanData.startedAt) * feePerDay) /86400); //@audit-issue incorrect fee calculation ,deadline instead of duration
        if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
            feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
        } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) { 
            feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
        }

        misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
    }
