# Failure to Adhere to (CEI) pattern in createBorrowOrder() function and no state checks

### Summary

The createBorrowOrder() function does not follow the CEI pattern, which can lead to reentrancy vulnerabilities and state inconsistencies. External token transfers are executed before updating the contract's state, exposing it to potential exploits and operational errors.

### Root Cause

External Calls Before State Updates:
The function performs token transfers (IERC721.transferFrom or SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom) before updating state variables (borrowOrderIndex, allActiveBorrowOrders, activeOrdersCount).
This violates the CEI pattern, which ensures internal state updates are completed before making external interactions. 

State Update Timing Risk:
If external token transfers fail or are exploited, the contractâ€™s state remains inconsistent with actual operations.

### Internal pre-conditions

1) _collateral is a valid ERC-721 or ERC-20 token address.
2)  _isNFT determines the type of collateral.
3)  The state variables (borrowOrderIndex, allActiveBorrowOrders, activeOrdersCount) are updated after external calls.

### External pre-conditions

- The external token transfer can fail or behave unexpectedly without triggering a revert.
- A malicious ERC-721 or ERC-20 token contract can trigger a reentrant call during transferFrom or safeTransferFrom.

### Attack Path

1) Deploy a malicious token contract with a reentrant transferFrom or safeTransferFrom.
2) Call createBorrowOrder() with _collateral pointing to the malicious contract.
3) During the external token transfer, execute recursive calls to createBorrowOrder() or other vulnerable functions.
4) Exploit inconsistencies in state updates to disrupt logic or steal funds.

### Impact

State Inconsistency:
- Failed or exploited token transfers can leave the state variables (borrowOrderIndex, allActiveBorrowOrders, activeOrdersCount) in an inconsistent or invalid state.
Phantom borrow orders or broken references may result, impacting contract functionality and user trust.

Reentrancy Vulnerability:
Recursive calls to createBorrowOrder() can disrupt state updates and logic flow.
This could result in duplicate borrow orders or unauthorized transactions.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- After token transfers, validate balances or token ownership to confirm successful execution. Example: 
require(IERC20(_collateral).balanceOf(address(borrowOffer)) >= _collateralAmount, "Transfer failed");  
- Use the nonReentrant modifier to block recursive calls. 

Follow the CEI Pattern:
borrowOrderIndex[address(borrowOffer)] = activeOrdersCount;  
allActiveBorrowOrders[activeOrdersCount] = address(borrowOffer);  
activeOrdersCount++;  

if (_isNFT) {  
    IERC721(_collateral).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(borrowOffer), _receiptID);  
} else {  
    SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(IERC20(_collateral), msg.sender, address(borrowOffer), _collateralAmount);  
}
