# Uninitialized aggregatorContract Address in Factory Contracts

### Summary
The handling of the aggregatorContract address in both `DBOFactory` and `DLOFactory` contracts contains a critical oversight. The aggregatorContract variable defaults to address(0) if not explicitly set before creating instances of `DBOImplementation` and `DLOImplementation`. This oversight introduces potential misconfigurations that compromise the functionality of the system, specifically impacting functions restricted by the `onlyAggregator` modifier. While the contracts assume trusted ownership to set this address correctly, this assumption does not fully mitigate risks of human error or malicious behavior.

### Vulnerability Details
## Affected Contracts:
1. `DBOFactory`
2. `DLOFactory`

Root Cause:
The `aggregatorContract` address is declared but not assigned a value by default in the factory contracts. When the `createBorrowOrder` or `createLendOrder` functions are called, a new instance of the respective implementation contract `(DBOImplementation or DLOImplementation)` is created and initialized using the uninitialized `aggregatorContract` address.

### Code Snippets:
`DBOFactory`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L75-L123
`DLOFactory`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L124-L175

## Affected codes:

`DBOFactory`:
```solidity
address aggregatorContract; // Uninitialized, defaults to address(0)

function createBorrowOrder(...) external {
    DBOImplementation borrowOffer = new DBOImplementation();
    borrowOffer.initialize(
        aggregatorContract, // Defaults to address(0) if not set
        ...
    );
}
```
`DLOFactory`:
```solidity
address aggregatorContract; // Uninitialized, defaults to address(0)

function createLendOrder(...) external {
    DLOImplementation lendOffer = new DLOImplementation();
    lendOffer.initialize(
        aggregatorContract, // Defaults to address(0) if not set
        ...
    );
}
```

`DBOImplementation/DLOImplementation`:
The `initialize` function in both implementation contracts assigns the `_aggregatorContract` parameter to the state variable `aggregatorContract`.
```solidity
function initialize(address _aggregatorContract, ...) public initializer {
    aggregatorContract = _aggregatorContract;
}
```
The `onlyAggregator` modifier restricts certain critical functions to the aggregatorContract. If aggregatorContract is `address(0)`, these functions become unusable because the require statement will always fail:

```solidity
modifier onlyAggregator() {
    require(msg.sender == aggregatorContract, "Only aggregator");
    _;
}
```
### Impact

1. Functionality Breakdown: Functions restricted by onlyAggregator will revert if aggregatorContract is address(0). This renders the system non-functional for any operations dependent on the aggregatorContract.

2. Risk of Misconfiguration: The responsibility of setting the aggregatorContract is placed on the contract owner, relying on trust and correct execution. A failure to set the address before invoking createBorrowOrder or createLendOrder can disrupt the system's workflow.

### Mitigation
## Enforce Address Check Before Initialization:
Add a require statement in the factory contracts to ensure that aggregatorContract is properly set before creating new instances of the implementation contracts:

```solidity
require(aggregatorContract != address(0), "Aggregator contract not set");
```
