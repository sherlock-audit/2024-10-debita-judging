# Valid principle may not be counted at `DebitaIncentives::updateFunds`

### Summary

Let's consider the [updateFunds function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L306). It is called at the end of `matchOffersV3` execution and should record information about each user and the amount of principle he lent and received. Depending on this amount, incentive funds are distributed among the users.

```solidity
    function updateFunds(
        infoOfOffers[] memory informationOffers,
        address collateral,
        address[] memory lenders,
        address borrower
    ) public onlyAggregator {
        for (uint i = 0; i < lenders.length; i++) {
            bool validPair = isPairWhitelisted[informationOffers[i].principle][
                collateral
            ];
            if (!validPair) {
                return;
            }
            address principle = informationOffers[i].principle;

            uint _currentEpoch = currentEpoch();

            lentAmountPerUserPerEpoch[lenders[i]][
                hashVariables(principle, _currentEpoch)
            ] += informationOffers[i].principleAmount;
            totalUsedTokenPerEpoch[principle][
                _currentEpoch
            ] += informationOffers[i].principleAmount;
            borrowAmountPerEpoch[borrower][
                hashVariables(principle, _currentEpoch)
            ] += informationOffers[i].principleAmount;

            emit UpdatedFunds(
                lenders[i],
                principle,
                collateral,
                borrower,
                _currentEpoch
            );
        }
    }
```
Note that informationOffers contains information about loans issued.

Loans always have one token for collateral, but not necessarily one for principle. That is, informationOffers can store loans with several principles but different collateral.

Each loan is processed sequentially. We are interested in this point.

```solidity
 bool validPair = isPairWhitelisted[informationOffers[i].principle][
                collateral
            ];
            if (!validPair) {
                return;
            }
```

We see that if some principle,collateral pair has not been whitelisted - the function return. Thus, it aborts its execution and no loan will be processed after this one. Thus, users with valid principles,collateral will not get enough rewards as the function will not count their share.


### Root Cause

The function calls return without processing the whole array to the end.


### Internal pre-conditions

There will be at least one principle in matchedOffers for which the principle pair, collateral collateral is not whitelisted in the DebitaIncentives contract.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Some users will get less rewards than they should have.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use continue instead of return
