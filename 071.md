# Attacker manipulates precision loss to overcharge borrower on APR

### Summary

The matchOffersV3 function in the loan contract calculates the `weightedAverageAPR` using integer division, leading to cumulative precision loss. This results in a discrepancy between the advertised `maxApr` and the actual APR borrowers pay (maxAPR + 28). Borrowers unknowingly pay higher interest, violating the APR constraint defined in the borrow order.
**This vulnerability occurs not only for "APR" but also for "Ratio".**

### Root Cause

1. **Integer division precision loss:**  
   - The `updatedLastApr` calculation uses integer division, truncating fractional values:
   - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L477
     ```solidity
     uint updatedLastApr = (weightedAverageAPR[principleIndex] * amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex]) /
         (amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex] + lendAmountPerOrder[i]);
     ```
   - Over multiple iterations, the truncation compounds, reducing the computed `weightedAverageAPR`.

2. **Small lend amounts:**  
   - Small values in `lendAmountPerOrder` (e.g., `1`) exacerbate precision loss as their contribution is disproportionately affected by rounding.

3. **Discrepancy between enforcement and charged APR:**  
   - Borrowers expect `weightedAverageAPR` to adhere to `maxApr`, but the actual APR charged is derived from the lenders' APR (`lendInfo.apr`), which remains unaffected by rounding.

### Attack Path

#### **Scenario**
- Borrower's `maxApr`: **3,000**.
- **Attack Plan**: Exploit the precision loss in `weightedAverageAPR` calculation by creating multiple `LendOffers` with highly skewed `lendAmount` values and a consistent `lendInfo.apr` of **3028**. The goal is to manipulate the calculation so that the `weightedAverageAPR` appears to be **3000**, while the borrower effectively pays **3028** APR.

#### **Steps**
1. **Borrower Prepares to Take Loan**:
   - The borrower creates a borrow order with a collateral that allows an `availableAmount` of **10,028e12** and specifies a `maxApr` of **3000**.(10,028e12 and 3000 are selected for simple calculation and any values are ok.)

2. **Attacker Creates Lend Offers**:
   - The attacker creates **29 LendOffers**, distributing the `lendAmount` as follows:
     - **LendOffer 1**: `lendAmount = 10000e12`, `lendInfo.apr = 3028`.
     - **LendOffers 2 to 29**: `lendAmount = 1e12`, `lendInfo.apr = 3028`.

   **This vulnerability occurs not only for "APR" but also for "Ratio".**

### Impact
1. **Borrower Overpayment:**  
   - Borrowers pay more interest than anticipated, leading to hidden costs.
#### **What is more serious is when the borrower calculates the exact amount of token to pay the debt and then proceeds `payDebt`, it will be reverted with unexpected reason. So the severity is HIGH.**
   **The larger the amount of token borrowed, the more severe the consequences.**
#### Please refer to PoC for detailed explanation.

2. **Protocol Reputation Damage:**  
   - This discrepancy undermines trust, as the protocol does not transparently enforce the advertised `maxApr`.

3. **Legal and Regulatory Risks:**  
   - Failure to enforce accurate APR disclosures could expose the protocol to legal challenges.

### PoC

#### Scenario:  
- `lendAmountPerOrder`: `[10000e18, 1e18, 1e18, ..., 1e18]` (29 values - lendOrders.length < 30).  
- `lendInfo.apr`: `3028` for all lenders.  
- Borrow order `maxApr`: `3000`.  

#### Observed Behavior:  
1. **Calculated `weightedAverageAPR`:**  
   `weightedAverageAPR = (3028 * 10000e18) / 10000e18= 3027.`
   `weightedAverageAPR = (3027 * 10000e18) / 10001e18 + (3028 * 1e18) / 10001e18 = 3026.`
   `weightedAverageAPR = (3026 * 10001e18) / 10002e18 + (3028 * 1e18) / 10002e18 = 3025.`
   `weightedAverageAPR = (3025 * 10002e18) / 10003e18 + (3028 * 1e18) / 10003e18 = 3024.`
    ...
   After 100 iterations, `weightedAverageAPR` is truncated to **3000** due to integer division.  

3. **Actual APR Charged:**  
   Borrower is charged an effective APR of **3028**, derived directly from the lenders' `lendInfo.apr`.

Length of borrow = 80day!
The borrow calculates the max interest with apr=3000: 
           interest = 10028e18 * 3000 / 10000 * 80days / 31536000 = 659e18
           total = 10028e18 + 659e18 = 10,687e18
So the borrow prepares the amount of 10687e18 and tries to `payDebt` on the last day of borrow.
If it's 12h before the borrow finish, the borrower thinks that amount is sufficient since there are 12 hours left..
But the real interest(79.day, 3000 apr) and the attacked interest(79.5day, 3028 apr) are:
         real interest = 10028e18 * 3000 / 10000 * 79.5days / 31536000 = 654e18
         attacked interest = 10028e18 * 3028 / 10000 * 79.5days / 31536000 = 661e18
         loss = 7e18
#### This loss cannot be viewed as a simple precision loss, and the longer the loan period and loan amount, the more significant the loss.
#### And also `PayDebt` reverts even when the borrower believes he has sufficient funds.

### Mitigation

1. **Accumulate Weighted Contributions and Divide by Total Principle Amount:**  
   - For each principle, calculate the weighted contribution of each lenderâ€™s APR (lendInfo.apr) based on their lent amount (lendAmountPerOrder[i]).:
     ```solidity
     weightedAverageRatio[principleIndex] += lendInfo.apr * lendAmountPerOrder[i];
     amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex] += lendAmountPerOrder[i];
     ```
   - After processing all lend orders, calculate the weighted average by dividing the accumulated value by the total amount lent for the given principle (amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex]).
     ```solidity
        weightedAverageRatio[principleIndex] /= amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex];
     ```

2. **Use fixed-point arithmetic:**  
   - Perform calculations with higher precision (e.g., 18 decimals) using fixed-point libraries like OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` or `PRBMath`:
     ```solidity
     uint updatedLastApr = (weightedAverageAPR[principleIndex] * amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex] * 10**PRECISION) /
         ((amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex] + lendAmountPerOrder[i]) * 10**PRECISION);
     ```

3. **Cap Small Contributions:**  
   - Set a minimum threshold for `lendAmountPerOrder` to ensure meaningful contributions:
     ```solidity
     require(lendAmountPerOrder[i] >= MINIMUM_AMOUNT, "Lend amount too small");
     ```
