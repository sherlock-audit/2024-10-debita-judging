# Attacker Can Cut Expansion Minting Amount by 50%

### Summary

When calling for an expansion on Good Dollar, the `lastExpansion` time is set to block.timestamp regardless of what point in the frequency period you're at. It then requires a full `expansionFrequency` period to be able to be called again.

Because of this, an attacker can wait 1.99 periods from the last expansion, call to expand, and `lastExpansion` will be set to block.timestamp. The next expansion can then only be called once 2.99 periods have passed, and `numberOfExpansions` to be calculated will be rounded down so, in what should be 3 periods, only 2 expansions occur.

If an attacker keeps this up, they can send a transaction every 1.99 periods to effectively half the amount of expansions that occur.

### Internal pre-conditions

n/a

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `mintUBIFromExpansion` function after 1.99 frequency periods have passed.
2. Attacker continues to do the same.


### Impact

The amount that should be able to be minted from expansion is cut by 50%.


### PoC
