# Invalid lendIds can still remain in the Market




### Summary

`lendId` is a NFT which represents the ownership of an Offer attached to a loan.Hence , the `lendId` remains in the market untill it is burned. 

However, due to the absence of code to burn the `lendId` after the offer has been fully repaid and the debt has been claimed by the lender, the `lendId` remains available in the market.

This will question the existence of `OwnershipContract` that is supposed to give the users the information about the Offers validity before `acquiring` the `NFT` , rendering the functionality of the contract useless.


### Root Cause

There are 2 cases when a lendId should be burned

1. Once the Offer has been paid and debt has been claimed.
2. Offer couldnt be paid by the borrower and hence the collateral is claimed by the lender.[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L363)
 
2nd point has been dealt accurately by burning the lendId after making `loanData._acceptedOffers[index].collateralClaimed` as `true`

Considering the 1st point, there are 2 sub cases

1.1 `Lender` is `not perpetual`,hence the `lender` can call `claimDebt()` anytime after to retrieve the amount.
    Here `loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed ` is made `true` and the `lendId` is burned for that `lender`.[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L300)

1.2 `Lender` is `perpetual` and the total amount is transferred to the `LendOrder` as a result.
    Here we are marking  `loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true` indicating the offers validity is over.
    
    But the `protocol` fails to burn the `lendId` this time.

```solidity
            if (lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer) {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
                IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);
                lendOffer.addFunds(total);
```



### Internal pre-conditions
Borrower has paid the debt of a perpetual lenders offer.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This will impact the design and efficiency of the protocol by letting malicious actors exploit the presence of unburned lendIds to mislead or defraud other users and hence it will question the existence of `OwnershipContract` that is supposed to give the users the information about the `Offers` validity before `acquiring` the `NFT` , rendering the functionality of the contract useless.

### PoC
_No response_

### Mitigation
Burn the lendId once the loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true.
