# POTENTIAL DOS ATTACK IN THE `DebitaIncentives.sol::claimIncentives` FUNCTION, CAUSED BY UNBOUNDED NESTED FOR LOOP, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN USER FUNDS BEING LOCKED UP.

# SUMMARY  
The `claimIncentives` function in `DebitaIncentives.sol` is vulnerable to a potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack due to unbounded nested loops over user-supplied arrays (`principles` and `tokensIncentives`). This could lead to excessive gas consumption, making the function unusable for real users and potentially locking up their funds.

# ROOT CAUSE  
The vulnerability arises from the function iterating over two user-supplied arrays:  
1. **`principles`**: A single loop iterates over its length without any restriction, allowing an attacker to supply a large array.  
2. **`tokensIncentives[i]`**: For each `principle`, a nested loop iterates over the corresponding incentives array, further compounding the gas cost if both arrays are large.  

Additionally, the function relies on mappings for calculations (`lentAmountPerUserPerEpoch`, `totalUsedTokenPerEpoch`, etc.), but these mappings are not validated for bounds or integrity, potentially compounding gas costs.  

---

# INTERNAL PRECONDITION  
1. The contract assumes that:  
   - `principles` and `tokensIncentives` arrays are of manageable lengths.  
2. It does not validate or impose length constraints on `principles` or `tokensIncentives`.  
  

---

# EXTERNAL PRECONDITION  
1. An attacker has the ability to call the `claimIncentives` function and supply large arrays (`principles` and `tokensIncentives`).  
2. There are no explicit mechanisms to restrict maliciously large inputs or enforce gas efficiency.  
3. The function is called in a high-usage scenario where legitimate users depend on it for claiming their funds.  

---

# ATTACK PATH  
1. The attacker calls `claimIncentives`, supplying:  
   - A very large `principles` array.  
   - Nested `tokensIncentives` arrays of significant size for each entry in `principles`.  
2. The excessive iterations in the unbounded loops consume all the available gas, leading to the function execution being reverted.  
3. Legitimate users are unable to claim their incentives due to the high gas requirement or repeated reverts caused by malicious inputs.

# MITIGATION  
1. **Impose Length Constraints**:  
```diff
+    uint256 public constant MAX_LIMIT = 50;
     function claimIncentives(
        address[] memory principles,
        address[][] memory tokensIncentives,
        uint epoch
    ) public {
        require(epoch < currentEpoch(), "Epoch not finished");
        // e for looop from zero o the lenght of the principle
        // @audit suspect DOS, as long as principle length can be accessed it can be increased to cause a DOS
+       require(principles.length <= MAX_LIMIT, "Array size too large");
        require (tokensIncentives[i].length <= MAX_LIMIT, "Limit too large");
        for (uint i; i < principles.length; i++) {
        /// contiuation of code to the next loop
        }
    }

```
2. **Batch Processing**:  
   - Break the claim process into smaller chunks that can be processed in separate tx.
