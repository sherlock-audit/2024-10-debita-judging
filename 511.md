# Variable Shadowing in `ChangeOwner` Function of multiple contracts Prevents Ownership Transfer

### Summary

The `changeOwner` function is used in 3 different contracts:
- [debitaV3Aggregator.sol: 683](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682), 
- [AuctionFactory.sol:219](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218), 
-  [buyOrderFactory.sol: 186](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186), 


 The function is all three instances is unusable and does not update the `owner` state variable due to `variable shadowing`. 
- The authorization check `require(msg.sender == owner)`  validates `msg.sender` against the input parameter `owner ` instead of the state variable `owner`, making it impossible for the current owner to call the function (with a new owner address).
- The local function parameter "owner" `shadows the state variable`, causing the assignment statement to have no effect on the intended state variable. 
As a result, `the owner of the contract cannot be changed using this function.`

### Root Cause
 `changeOwner` function of three contracts:

```solidity
 @-->  function changeOwner(address owner) public { //@audit : input param has same name as state var
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
          ......
           .......
        owner = owner;
    }

```
The Input parameter `owner` in `changeOwner` has the same name as the state variable `owner` of the contract. Within the function, the local parameter takes precedence, effectively "hiding" the state variable. 
        - so everytime `owner` calls `changeOwner` function with a new owner address as input argument, the `require` statement does not pass. 
        - also, the statement `owner = owner; ` only operates on the local parameter and does not modify the state variable.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.Owner has to  call `changeOwner` function . 

### Impact

- After Initial deployment,  any attempt to transfer/change ownership fails. 


### PoC

In file `BasicDebitaAggregator.t.sol` 

add the following test function in `DebitaAggregatorTest` contract:

```solidity
function testChangeOwnerBug() public {
    // Get initial owner (deployer/test contract)
    address initialOwner = address(this);
    address newOwner = address(0x123);

   
    
    //   - should fail because msg.sender is checked against input parameter , not original owner
    vm.prank(initialOwner);
    vm.expectRevert("Only owner");  // Reverts because msg.sender != owner parameter
    DebitaV3AggregatorContract.changeOwner(newOwner);

   
}
```

### Mitigation

Use a different variable name for input param instead of `owner` 

```solidity
function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");  // checks against state variable
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = _newOwner;  // proper assignment
}
```
