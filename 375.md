# `DebitaLoan` uses `ERC20.approve` instead of safe approvals, causing it to always revert on some ERC20s

### Summary
The `debitav3loan` contract employs the `IERC20::approve` function in key operations like loan repayment (payDebt) and collateral auction creation (createAuctionForCollateral). However, tokens like USDT that deviate from the ERC20 standard and do not return a boolean on approve cause these operations to fail. This restricts borrower repayment and auction processes for such tokens, creating potential disruptions for both lenders and borrowers.
### Vulnerability Details
1. **Affected Functions:**
(a). **payDebt:**
Calls approve to enable repayment or addition of funds to perpetual offers. Incompatible tokens (e.g., USDT) fail this step, blocking repayments.
(b). **createAuctionForCollateral:**
Uses approve to authorize collateral transfers to the auction factory. Tokens that do not return a boolean disrupt the auction process.
2. **Root Cause:**
The `IERC20::approve` function assumes a boolean return value, which is not implemented by certain tokens like USDT on Ethereum mainnet.
**Examples:**
USDT (Ethereum): A widely-used token that fails to adhere to the standard, as it does not return a value on approve calls.

### Impact
1.  **Borrowers:**
Unable to repay loans using incompatible tokens.Repayment delays could lead to penalties or loss of assets.
2.  **Lenders:**
Collateral auctions cannot be initiated, locking collateral and delaying liquidation or recovery processes.
### Recommendation 
Use `safeApprove` instead of `approve` .
