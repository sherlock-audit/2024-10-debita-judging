# Absence of confidence level check in `DebitaPyth` oracle

### Summary

Absence of confidence level check in `DebitaPyth` oracle can lead to bad prices being accepted by the protocol. As stated in the [Pyth docs](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals), it is very important to check the confidence level because otherwise the protocol can accept invalid or untrusted prices. 

### Root Cause

Absence of confidence level check 

### Internal pre-conditions

The `matchOffersV3` function is called and confidence level is not checked 

### External pre-conditions

Some kind of move in the crypto market 

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This issue can result an unfair collateral/principle ration for users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add this check after fetching the asset price in the [`getThePrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaPyth.sol#L25) function, after fetching the price:
```javascript
 if (priceData.conf > 0 && (priceData.price / int64(priceData.conf) < minConfidenceRatio)) {
          revert <Some_Custom_Error>;
      }
```
As for the `minConfidenceRatio` variable, it can be variable in a struct that is unique for every pricefeed. 

Note that if the confidence interval is 0 there is no spread in price, so the price should be considered valid
