# Due to incorrect `claimCollateralAsLender()` implementation a lender can lose access to NFT collateral after liquidation

### Summary

When a loan based on NFT collateral is liquidated the lender has two options for claiming it:
1. Create an auction for the NFT and after it is bought claim the underlying ERC20s.
2. Claim the NFT directly - possible ONLY when they are a lonely lender ( `m_loan._acceptedOffers.length == 1` ).
Calling `claimCollateralAsLender()` when both of these conditions are not met should result in an error - suggesting that the lender should create an auction first. However, when this function is called in this situation, lender's ownership NFT is burned while the function returns without transferring the collateral. 

### Root Cause

`claimCollateralAsNFTLender()` function returns a boolean indicating whether the collateral is claimed. Unfortunately, in `claimCollateralAsLender()` this return value is ignored :

because of this, the ownership NFT is burned even though the lender failed to claim collateral.

### Internal pre-conditions

- liquidation of a loan with NFT collateral has occurred
- lender calls the function in a specific state ( auction was not initialized and there are more than 1 lend offers matched in that loan )

### External pre-conditions

### Impact

Permanent loss of significant funds for the lender due to a simple mistake call that should always revert. Lenders should not lose the right to claim liquidated collateral under ANY circumstances. Here the issue requires a specific state to happen, but lost funds can be arbitrarily large - depending on the collateral's value even thousands of $. 


### PoC

The PoC shows exactly how all funds are lost after an unsuccessful call to `claimCollateralAsLender()` due to a lack of ownership token.

Place the following test case in `OracleOneLenderLoanReceipt.t.sol` file:
```solidity
    error ERC721NonexistentToken(uint);
    // testDefaultAndAuctionCall test modified to simulate the mistake call and prove permanent loss of funds
    function test_lenderCanLoseCollateral() public {
        MatchOffers();
        uint[] memory indexes = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
        indexes[0] = 0;
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 8640010);

        // Here, the auction should have been initialized and NFT sold
       
        // claim sold Amount
        uint balanceBefore = AEROContract.balanceOf(lender);
        DebitaV3LoanContract.claimCollateralAsLender(0);
        uint balanceAfter = AEROContract.balanceOf(lender);
        assertEq(balanceBefore, balanceAfter);
        
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(ERC721NonexistentToken.selector, 1));
        DebitaV3LoanContract.claimCollateralAsLender(0);

    }
```
Run it with:
```shell
forge test --fork-url https://mainnet.base.org --fork-block-number 21151256  --mt test_lenderCanLoseCollateral --mc DebitaAggregatorTest  -vvvvv
```

### Mitigation

To follow the style of other functions, consider removing the returned boolean value from `claimCollateralAsNFTLender()` and simply revert when the auction is not initialized or the number of accepted offers is different than 1:
```solidity
require(m_loan.auctionInitialized || (m_loan._acceptedOffers.length == 1 && !m_loan.auctionInitialized));
```
