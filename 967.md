# The DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3() function reverts when lendOrders's length is greater than 30 due to inconsistency of parameters

### Summary

In the DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3() function, there is a check for lendOrders.length, which should be equal or less than 100. This function deploys a DebitaV3Loan proxy and invokes initialize() function.

However, in DebitaV3Loan.initialize() function there is restriction about _acceptedOffers.length should be less than 30, which contradicts to a check of DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3() function.

### Root Cause

In the [DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:290](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L290) function, there is a check for lendOrders.length, which should be equal or less than 100.

```solidity
     function matchOffersV3(
        address[] memory lendOrders,
        uint[] memory lendAmountPerOrder,
        uint[] memory porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder,
        address borrowOrder,
        address[] memory principles,
        uint[] memory indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder,
        uint[] memory indexForCollateral_LendOrder,
        uint[] memory indexPrinciple_LendOrder
    ) external nonReentrant returns (address) {

        ...

@>      require(lendOrders.length <= 100, "Too many lend orders");

        ...
    }
```

Also in the [DebitaV3Loan.sol:156](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L156) function, there is restriction for the length of _acceptedOffers should be less than 30.


```solidity
    function initialize(
        address _collateral,
        address[] memory _principles,
        bool _isCollateralNFT,
        uint _NftID,
        uint _collateralAmount,
        uint _valuableCollateralAmount,
        uint valuableCollateralUsed,
        address valuableAsset,
        uint _initialDuration,
        uint[] memory _principlesAmount,
        uint _borrowerID,
        infoOfOffers[] memory _acceptedOffers,
        address m_OwnershipContract,
        uint feeInterestLender,
        address _feeAddress
    ) public initializer nonReentrant {

        ...

@>      require(_acceptedOffers.length < 30, "Too many offers");

        ...
    }
```

However, the length of lendOrders and _acceptedOffers is equal, so when it is greater than 30, the DebitaV3Loan.initialize() function will revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

In the DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3() function, the length of param lendOrders is greater than 30.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Even thougth the borrow offer is matched with lend offers, it will revert in previous case.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Correct one check of both function.

    function initialize(
        address _collateral,

        bool _isCollateralNFT,
        uint _NftID,
        uint _collateralAmount,
        uint _valuableCollateralAmount,
        uint valuableCollateralUsed,
        address valuableAsset,
        uint _initialDuration,
        uint[] memory _principlesAmount,
        uint _borrowerID,
        infoOfOffers[] memory _acceptedOffers,
        address m_OwnershipContract,
        uint feeInterestLender,
        address _feeAddress
    ) public initializer nonReentrant {

        ...

-       require(_acceptedOffers.length < 30, "Too many offers");
+       require(_acceptedOffers.length < 100, "Too many offers");

        ...
    }
```
