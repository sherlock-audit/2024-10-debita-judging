# `DebitaLoanOwnership::onlyOwner` Modifier Bypassed Due to Missing Initialization Update Logic

### Summary

In the `DebitaLoanOwnership` contract, both the `DebitaContract` and the `admin` addresses can be updated even after the contract's initialization. This occurs because the contract's `onlyOwner` modifier relies on the `initialized` variable to prevent updates after initialization, but there is no mechanism to update the `initialized` flag. As a result, the modifier's condition (`require(msg.sender == admin && !initialized)`) will always evaluate to `true`, allowing the `admin` to repeatedly update critical addresses, undermining the intended access control.

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() {
@>    require(msg.sender == admin && !initialized);
    _;
}
```

```solidity
function setDebitaContract(address newContract) public onlyOwner {
    DebitaContract = newContract;
}
```

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address _newAddress) public onlyOwner {
    admin = _newAddress;
}
```

The `onlyOwner` modifier is intended to restrict certain functions to the `admin` address, provided the contract has not been marked as `initialized`. However, because there is no logic in the contract to set the `initialized` variable to `true` after initialization, it remains `false` indefinitely. Consequently, the `admin` address is able to modify the `DebitaContract` address and transfer ownership at any time, effectively bypassing the intended one-time initialization restriction.

Finally, the intended behavior of the `initialized` flag aligns with similar patterns in other parts of the code, where the ownership cannot be transferred once a certain period has passed after contract deployment.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaLoanOwnerships](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol#L18) , there is no implemented logic to update the `initialized` flag, which prevents the contract from properly enforcing the intended restrictions on critical functions after initialization.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This issue allows the contract's owner (`admin`) to retain the ability to make critical updates to the contract state indefinitely, which could lead to the centralization of control and potential security risks, such as unauthorized modifications.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a mechanism to set the `initialized` flag to `true` once the `DebitaContract` and `admin` addresses have been configured, ensuring that further modifications to these addresses are properly restricted.
