# WBTC had not been accounted for its 8 decimals nature

### Summary

WBTC have 8 decimals on Arbitrum & Optimism & on Base chain as well.

There are numerous functions which do calculations without regards to its 8 decimals nature and the perfect example to show you is `DebitaV3Loan::calculateInterestToPay()`.

If I have to pay interest (APR - 2.35%, initialDuration - 7 days) on 0.009 WBTC which as writing this in Wednesday 20.11 is over $94.000 per BTC - so 0.009 will be ~$850.

Let's say that I want to repay my debt the first day - 86 400 seconds

The calculation will look as follows - `(1e8 * 0.009 * 235 / 10_000) * 86 400 / 31_536_000 = 57.96` (accounting for the decimal of course, not 57.96 bitcoins), which will **round down the amount** to 57 WBTC (accounting for the decimal), thus losing almost 2% of the interest that should've been paid to the lender, but it is being rounded down.

### Root Cause

Account for rounding in tokens are that not 18 decimals, such as WBTC in this example and the attack will be especially more prevalent when the lender is a perpetual one, so he will just lend the money and think about how he is getting the fees he deserves, but those 2% are more than significant to be accounted for and in the scenario I described, it will be 50 cents.

Imagine those 50 cents or more how it will affect the perpetual if it is on for a year or more, it will accumulate and be more than $10 as time passes and more and more loans are repaid.

### Internal pre-conditions

The rounding down will happen in certain conditions, APR and amounts,
 but is a real issue that will occur in the protocol when they're met.
