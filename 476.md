# Loans will not be repayable even though the deadline has not passed

### Summary

A lend offer can be repaid as long as [the following condition](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L195) is true: `nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp`. However, when the maximum deadline of each accepted offer the borrower wants to repay is checked, this restriction differs: `offer.maxDeadline > block.timestamp`.

This means that if the `nextDeadline()` of the loan is equal to the `maxDeadline` of the lend offer the borrower wants to repay at the timestamp of the next deadline, they will not be able to repay the offer. Consequently, the loan will be considered defaulted, even though the borrower wanted to repay their debt in time.

This situation occurs when a borrow offer with `duration = x` is [matched](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L434) with a lend offer with `maxDuration = x`.

### Root Cause

[DebitaV3Loan::payDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L210) does not support cases where an accepted offer's `maxDeadline` is equal to the loan's `nextDeadline()` .

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3()` is called to match a borrow offer with `duration = x` with a lend offer with `maxDuration = x`.
2. The borrower calls `DebitaV3Loan::payDebt()` at the exact time of the next deadline to repay an offer. If the offer's maximum deadline is equal to the next deadline, the call will revert and the loan will be defaulted.

### Impact

Whenever the 'maxDeadline' of the offer borrowers want to repay matches the `nextDeadline()`, they will not be able to repay their debt even though they should be allowed to. The loan will be defaulted and the collateral will be at least partially lost.

### PoC

The following should be added to `TwoLendersERC20Loan.t.sol`:

```solidity
DLOImplementation public AnotherLendOrder;
DBOImplementation public SecondBorrowOrder;
```

Additionally, this should be appended to `TwoLendersERC20Loan.t.sol::setUp()`:

```solidity
    AEROContract.approve(address(DLOFactoryContract), 5e18);
    ratio[0] = 1e18;
    address AnotherlendOrderAddress = DLOFactoryContract.createLendOrder(
        false,
        oraclesActivated,
        false,
        ltvs,
        1000,
        864000,
        86400,
        acceptedCollaterals,
        AERO,
        oraclesPrinciples,
        ratio,
        address(0x0),
        5e18
    );
    AnotherLendOrder = DLOImplementation(AnotherlendOrderAddress);

    vm.startPrank(borrower);

    IERC20(AERO).approve(address(DBOFactoryContract), 100e18);

    ratio[0] = 1e18;
    oraclesPrinciples[0] = address(0x0);
    acceptedPrinciples[0] = AERO;
    acceptedCollaterals[0] = USDC;
    oraclesActivated[0] = false;
    ltvs[0] = 0;

    USDCContract.approve(address(DBOFactoryContract), 11e18);
    address SecondborrowOrderAddress = DBOFactoryContract.createBorrowOrder(
        oraclesActivated,
        ltvs,
        1000,
        864000,
        acceptedPrinciples,
        USDC,
        false,
        0,
        oraclesPrinciples,
        ratio,
        address(0x0),
        5e18
    );
    vm.stopPrank();

    SecondBorrowOrder = DBOImplementation(SecondborrowOrderAddress);
```

The following test should be added to `TwoLendersERC20Loan.t.sol`:

```solidity
function testPayDebtRevertAtDeadline() public {
    address[] memory lendOrders = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
    uint[] memory lendAmountPerOrder = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(
        1
    );
    uint[] memory porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder = allDynamicData
        .getDynamicUintArray(1);
    address[] memory principles = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
    uint[] memory indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder = allDynamicData
        .getDynamicUintArray(1);
    uint[] memory indexForCollateral_LendOrder = allDynamicData
        .getDynamicUintArray(1);
    uint[] memory indexPrinciple_LendOrder = allDynamicData
        .getDynamicUintArray(1);

    lendOrders[0] = address(AnotherLendOrder);
    lendAmountPerOrder[0] = 25e17;
    porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder[0] = 10000;
    principles[0] = AERO;

    address loan = DebitaV3AggregatorContract.matchOffersV3(
        lendOrders,
        lendAmountPerOrder,
        porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder,
        address(SecondBorrowOrder),
        principles,
        indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder,
        indexForCollateral_LendOrder,
        indexPrinciple_LendOrder
    );

    DebitaV3LoanContract = DebitaV3Loan(loan);

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 864000);

    uint[] memory indexes = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
    indexes[0] = 0;
    vm.startPrank(borrower);
    AEROContract.approve(address(DebitaV3LoanContract), 6e18);
    vm.expectRevert("Deadline passed");
    DebitaV3LoanContract.payDebt(indexes);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

### Mitigation

`DebitaV3Loan::payDebt()` should allow repayments when an accepted offer's `maxDeadline` is equal to the `nextDeadline()`.
