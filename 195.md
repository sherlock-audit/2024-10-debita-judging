# Tokens that reverts on 0 transfer may cause the entire transaction to revert.

### Summary

The protocol contains multiple instances where tokens are transferred without checking if the amount is 0. Tokens like BNB, which revert on 0 transfers, can cause the entire transaction to fail.

### Root Cause

There's no check for zero amounts before transferring tokens.

For example, in `Auction.sol:buyNFT`:

```jsx
function buyNFT() public onlyActiveAuction {
...SNIP...

     SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
            msg.sender,
            feeAddress,
            feeAmount
        );
        
        ...SNIP...
        }
```

For public auctions, a 0 fee is permitted:

```jsx
function changePublicAuctionFee(uint _fee) public onlyOwner {
        // between 0% and 1%
  ->>   require(_fee <= 100 && _fee >= 0, "Invalid fee");
        publicAuctionFee = _fee;
    }
```

If the underlying token (e.g., BNB) reverts on 0 transfers, the transaction will always fail. While it's unlikely someone would auction veAERO for BNB, the possibility exists.

Beyond the auction contract, zero-amount transfers can occur in other parts of the code, such as when calculating fees in the aggregator contract or in the DebitaV3Loan contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

A token transfer amount must be 0 to trigger a revert. This scenario is possible in low-value trades where fees round down to 0.

### External pre-conditions

The admin must whitelist tokens like BNB that revert on 0 transfers.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The valid trades will revert causing the DOS for user.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a check to ensure the amount is non-zero before calling the transfer function on any ERC20 token.
