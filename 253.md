# matchOffersV3 will fail in the case of valuableAsset being an NFT

### Summary

`DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3` makes an invalid ERC20 Decimals Call in the case the `valuableAsset` is an NFT.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L371

### Root Cause

`DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3` is a very long function that attempts to handle many different scenarios.

The matchOffersV3 function incorrectly attempts to call decimals() on NFT collateral (If the underlying valueableAsset is an ERC721 token, due to the fact that ERC721 tokens do not work with decimals() )  by casting it to ERC20, causing all NFT-collateralized loans to revert.

```solidity
uint256 decimalsCollateral = ERC20(borrowInfo.valuableAsset).decimals();
```

This line assumes the valuable asset implements the ERC20 interface, which is invalid for NFT collateral (ERC721).


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

All NFT-collateralized loans will fail to execute
Core protocol functionality for NFT lending is completely broken
Users attempting to use NFTs as collateral will have their transactions revert

### PoC

User initiates loan with NFT collateral
borrowInfo.isNFT is set to true
Function attempts to call ERC20(nftAddress).decimals()
Transaction reverts as ERC721 doesn't implement decimals()

### Mitigation

Handle ERC721 cases differently, or divide the function in composable chunks for better management.
