# Incorrect Comparison in `payDebt()` : Should Use `>` Instead of `>=` for Deadline Check

## Summary
In the `payDebt` function of the contract, there is a deadline check using `nextDeadline() >= block.timestamp`. This comparison should instead be using `nextDeadline() > block.timestamp` to ensure that the deadline has not already passed when the user attempts to make a payment. The current check allows the borrower to make a payment exactly at the deadline time, which may not be the intended behavior.

## Vulnerability Details
### Root Cause:
The function compares the next deadline using >=, which permits payments exactly at the deadline time.
In this case, if nextDeadline() is equal to block.timestamp, the payment will be allowed, even though the deadline has technically passed.

## Code Snippet

## Expected Behavior:

1. The check should ensure that the current timestamp is strictly less than the deadline to prevent payments after the deadline has passed.
2. By using >=, the contract may allow payments at the exact deadline, which can lead to undesired behavior, especially in time-sensitive systems.
### Issue with the Current Comparison:
The borrower could potentially pay exactly at the deadline (when nextDeadline() equals block.timestamp), which may not align with the business logic or the intended functionality of the contract, where the payment should strictly happen before the deadline.
## Impact
The borrower can make payments exactly at the deadline, which may not be the intended behavior in the protocol. The payment should only be accepted if the current time is strictly before the deadline. This behavior could lead to edge-case issues with other time-dependent logic in the system, such as token transfers, fee calculations, or other contract interactions.
## Recommendation
To fix the issue, replace the >= operator with > in the require statement, ensuring that payments are only accepted if the deadline is strictly in the future.
