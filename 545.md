The following is the extract from the [contest's README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3-xiaoming9090?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate):

> Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?

Thus, Fee-on-Transfer (FOT) tokens are supported within the protocol as long as it is wrapped within the `TaxTokensReceipt contract`.

Assume that the FOT has a 10% transfer tax. Thus, if one transfers 100 FOT, the issuer will collect 10 FOT, and the recipient will receive 90 FOT.

Assume that Bob will create a borrow or lender offer using 100 FOT. In this case, he will call `TaxTokensReceipt.deposit(100 FOT)`.

The `balanceBefore` at Line 60 is zero at this point. Next, Line 61 below will attempt to pull 100 FOT from Bob's wallet. However, due to the 10% transfer tax, only 90 FOT will be transferred to the `TaxTokensReceipt` contract. Thus, the `difference` at Line 68 will be 90 FOT.

However, the issue is that in Line 71, the NFT's `tokenAmountPerID` is set to `amount`(100 FOT) instead of `difference` (90 FOT). Thus, the NFT's `lockedAmount` will show 100 FOT, while in reality, there is only 90 FOT residing in the NFT.

This is a major issue because the `TaxTokensReceipt` NFT is used as collateral within the borrow offer. Thus, the collateral within the borrow offer will be inflated. As a result, the protocol will assume that the borrow offer contains collateral that is worth much more than expected and allow them to borrow more principle than expected from the lenders, resulting in a loss for the affected lenders.

```solidity
File: TaxTokensReceipt.sol
58:     // expect that owners of the token will excempt from tax this contract
59:     function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
60:         uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
61:         SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
62:             ERC20(tokenAddress),
63:             msg.sender,
64:             address(this),
65:             amount
66:         );
67:         uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
68:         uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
69:         require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
70:         tokenID++;
71:         tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
72:         _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
73:         emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
74:         return tokenID;
75:     }
```

The second major issue due to this bug is that users will be unable to withdraw their assets from the `TaxTokensReceipt`.

`tokenAmountPerID` is set to 100 FOT, while in reality, there is only 90 FOT residing in the NFT. In this case, when Line 87 is executed, the transfer amount will be 100 FOT, which will result in a revert due to insufficient FOT. Thus, users cannot withdraw their 90 FOT under any circumstance.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L87

```solidity
File: TaxTokensReceipt.sol
76: 
77:     // withdraw the token
78:     function withdraw(uint _tokenID) public nonReentrant {
79:         require(
80:             ownerOf(_tokenID) == msg.sender,
81:             "TaxTokensReceipts: not owner"
82:         );
83:         uint amount = tokenAmountPerID[_tokenID];
84:         tokenAmountPerID[_tokenID] = 0;
85:         _burn(_tokenID);
86: 
87:         SafeERC20.safeTransfer(ERC20(tokenAddress), msg.sender, amount);
88:         emit Withdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
89:     }
```

### Impact

High. Loss of assets. Users cannot withdraw their assets and `TaxTokensReceipt` will be inflated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing the following changes so that the actual number of FOT transferred into the NFT will be reflected in the NFT's locked amount (= `tokenAmountPerID[tokenID]` ).

```diff
    function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
-        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
+        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = difference;
```
