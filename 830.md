# Missing vault related states update when burning receipt with VeNFTAerodrome::burnReceipt method.

### Summary

Vault related states are not updated when veNFTAerodrome::burnReceipt method is called as the owner  withdrawing her NFT .

### Root Cause

NFT receipt holder can withdraw  NFT from vault via withdraw() method in veNFTVault. Inside the withdraw function,  the holder needs to burn NFT receipt to get her NFT back.  However when burning receipt ID,  the vault related data is not updated, such as "s_ReceiptID_to_Vault[m_Receipt]"(=address(0)) and "isVaultValid[address(vault)]"(=false). This will leave the vault manager to be able to call calimBribes/reset/extend/poke functions even after the NFT been withdrawed from vault.
