# Gas Optimization Opportunities in Auction Contract#148 & #152

Gas Optimisation

### **Summary**

The` buyNFT` and function in the auction contract exhibit inefficient use of storage reads and redundant calculations. These inefficiencies unnecessarily increase gas costs, especially in high-frequency use cases. By addressing these, the protocol can significantly reduce gas expenses for users while improving overall contract performance.

**Before:**

```
IERC721 Token = IERC721(s_CurrentAuction.nftAddress);
Token.safeTransferFrom(
    address(this),
    msg.sender,
    _s_CurrentAuction.nftCollateralID_
);
```

**After Migration**

```
IERC721 Token = IERC721(m_currentAuction.nftAddress);
Token.safeTransferFrom(
    address(this),
    msg.sender,
    m_currentAuction.nftCollateralID
);

```

### **Impact**

Repeated storage reads and redundant computations lead to higher execution costs, directly impacting user experience and protocol efficiency.
