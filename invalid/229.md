### Summary

The function **getActiveAuctionOrders** in  **auctionFactoryDebita**  is used to list the active auction orders  and it takes two arguments **offset** and **limit**  the  **offset** is  let the user to chose from which location should we list and the **limit** is used to control the number of active auction we need to list and the   problem here is that  in the loop  when getting the active auction 
```solidity
 for (uint i = 0; (i + offset) < length; i++) {
            address order = allActiveAuctionOrders[offset + i];
            DutchAuction_veNFT.dutchAuction_INFO
                memory AuctionInfo = DutchAuction_veNFT(order).getAuctionData();
            result[i] = AuctionInfo;
        }
```as we can see      it is using `(i + offset) < length;`   it is using the **length**  as a last active auction  which is wrong lets say there is only 8 active auction and we wanted to get only the last 3 auction so we will     pass 5 as the **offset** and 3 as the **limit** arguments   but since the for loop is treating the limit  in a wrong way     and 5 is greater than 3 the for loop will not be executed which will make the function to return nothing
