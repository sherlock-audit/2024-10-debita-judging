# Rounding the division results in a loss of background for the lender and the protocol

### Summary

The rounding of divisions in `calculateInterestToPay()` result in a loss of funds for the user who lends his tokens and for the protocol.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L721
In `calculateInterestToPay()`, divisions rounded down to the nearest whole number.
For each interest calculation, the lender will earn less money than he is supposed to, and the same goes for the protocol. The borrower benefits by paying less interest.


### Impact

Loss of earnings for lenders and protocol

### PoC

We have the following calculations : 
```solidity
 uint anualInterest = (offer.principleAmount * offer.apr) / 10000;
        uint activeTime = block.timestamp - loanData.startedAt;
        uint minimalDurationPayment = (loanData.initialDuration * 1000) / 10000;
        uint maxDuration = offer.maxDeadline - loanData.startedAt;
        if (activeTime > maxDuration) {
            activeTime = maxDuration;
        } else if (activeTime < minimalDurationPayment) {
            activeTime = minimalDurationPayment;
        }

        uint interest = (anualInterest * activeTime) / 31536000;
```
Lets take an example with this variable : 
 principleAmout = 123 / apr = 150 (1,5%) /  activeTime=157680 => (1j 19h 48m)
annualInterest = (123 * 150) / 10000 = 18 
interest =(18 * 157680) / 31536000 =(18157680/31536000) = 0,09 -> 0 in solidity

With this example the borrower has 0 interest to repay !

### Mitigation

Add +1 after each division to round results up to the superior integer.
Change : 
```solidity 
        uint anualInterest = (offer.principleAmount * offer.apr) / 10000;
        uint minimalDurationPayment = (loanData.initialDuration * 1000) / 10000;
        uint interest = (anualInterest * activeTime) / 31536000;
```
by
```solidty
         uint anualInterest = (offer.principleAmount * offer.apr) / 10000 +1;
        uint minimalDurationPayment = (loanData.initialDuration * 1000) / 10000 +1;
        uint interest = (anualInterest * activeTime) / 31536000 + 1;

```
