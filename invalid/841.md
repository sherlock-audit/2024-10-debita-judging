# Incorrect Ownership Validation in `changeOwner` Function AuctionFactory.sol#218

**Summary**

The changeOwner function uses the msg.sender == owner condition to validate that the caller is the current owner. However, the owner parameter in the function shadows the state variable owner

```
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```

This leads to the function comparing msg.sender with the newly provided owner parameter instead of the current owner's address stored in the state variable. As a result, the condition will always evaluate to false, making it impossible for the function to be executed successfully under any circumstances.


**Impact**

The ownership of the contract cannot be changed under any condition. 

**Migration**

Add this require to migrate the output

`require(newOwner != owner, "New owner must be different from current owner");`
