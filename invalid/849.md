**Summary**

The `buyNFT` function lacks validation to ensure that the auction duration has not expired. This allows users to purchase an NFT even after the auction's intended timeframe has ended. 

```
function buyNFT() public onlyActiveAuction {
        // get memory data
        dutchAuction_INFO memory m_currentAuction = s_CurrentAuction;
        // get current price of the auction
        uint currentPrice = getCurrentPrice();
        // desactivate auction from storage
        s_CurrentAuction.isActive = false;
        uint fee;
        if (m_currentAuction.isLiquidation) {
            fee = auctionFactory(factory).auctionFee();
        } else {
            fee = auctionFactory(factory).publicAuctionFee();
        }

        // calculate fee
        uint feeAmount = (currentPrice * fee) / 10000;
        // get fee address
        address feeAddress = auctionFactory(factory).feeAddress();
        // Transfer liquidation token from the buyer to the owner of the auction
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
            msg.sender,
            s_ownerOfAuction,
            currentPrice - feeAmount
        );

        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
            msg.sender,
            feeAddress,
            feeAmount
        );

        // If it's a liquidation, handle it properly
        if (m_currentAuction.isLiquidation) {
            debitaLoan(s_ownerOfAuction).handleAuctionSell(
                currentPrice - feeAmount
            );
        }
        IERC721 Token = IERC721(s_CurrentAuction.nftAddress);
        Token.safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            msg.sender,
            s_CurrentAuction.nftCollateralID
        );

        auctionFactory(factory)._deleteAuctionOrder(address(this));
        auctionFactory(factory).emitAuctionDeleted(
            address(this),
            s_ownerOfAuction
        );
        // event offerBought
    }
```

The absence of expiration validation compromises the intended auction logic and can lead to undesired behavior, such as allowing buyers to acquire assets after the auction's deadline has passed.

**Impact**

Buyers can bypass the auction's time constraints, undermining trust in the auction process.  Late buyers might purchase an NFT at a lower price if the price decreases over time. Auction state and lifecycle logic are compromised, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Migration**

Add this require statement inside the function so it would prevent the late users to buy NFT after expiration

`require(block.timestamp <= m_currentAuction.endTime, "Auction has expired");`
