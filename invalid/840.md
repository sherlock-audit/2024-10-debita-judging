# Incorrect Implementation of `changeOwner()`

### Summary
The `changeOwner()` function in the `AuctionFactory.sol` contract is implemented incorrectly, making it unusable.

### Root Cause
because the `owner` variable and the input parameter of `changeOwner()` function have the same name. This leads to:
```solidity
address owner;
```
```solidity
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner;
}
```

When the current owner attempts to call `changeOwner()` function to update ownership, the following check:
```solidity
require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
```
compares `msg.sender` with the function’s input parameter `owner` instead of the contract’s `owner` address.

To pass this check, the owner would need to provide their own address as the input parameter, this makes the function meaningless because owner cannot transfer ownership to another address.

### Mitigation
rename the function parameter to avoid this issue:
```solidity
function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = newOwner;
}
```
