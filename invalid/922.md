# Missing Proper Assignment in changeOwner Function Allows Ownership Manipulation

### Summary

A missing proper assignment in the changeOwner function will cause an ownership transfer vulnerability for the contract as the function does not update the state variable, and malicious actors may exploit improper access control.

### Root Cause

In changeOwner function, the line owner = owner; mistakenly assigns the parameter owner to itself instead of updating the contract's owner state variable.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The function can be called multiple times, as the state variable is not updated, causing improper ownership access.

### Attack Path

Current owner calls changeOwner with their own address, expecting to change ownership but inadvertently retains ownership.
A malicious actor later calls the function within the 6-hour window with a carefully crafted payload that could exploit the unassigned owner variable.

### Impact

The contract owner remains unchanged, allowing malicious actors to potentially exploit this function for further vulnerabilities. Users or stakeholders relying on proper ownership changes may suffer operational losses.

### PoC

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ExploitOwner {
    address public owner;
    uint256 public deployedTime;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        deployedTime = block.timestamp;
    }

    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(block.timestamp <= deployedTime + 6 hours, "6 hours passed");
        owner = newOwner; // Correct assignment
    }
}

### Mitigation

Replace owner = owner; with owner = newOwner;.
Add validation to ensure the new owner address is valid:
Ensure the order of checks is logical and does not introduce further vulnerabilities.
