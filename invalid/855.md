# Incorrect deleting of borrow orders.

### Summary

When deleting a `borrowOrder` the contract handles it by assigning the `borrowOrderIndex` mapping of that order address to 0 and then replaces it's previous `borrowOrderIndex` with that of the last borrowOrder.

The issue stems from the fact that the first `borrowOrder` is assigned index 0 (based on the `activeOrdersCount`) which means one of two things
1. By default the first order has been deleted
2. There's an unintentional collision of orders spanning from the fact that if the first order was to be deleted the last order as well will be assigned a `borrowOrderIndex` of 0 there by actively deleting it without knowledge of the actors/owners of the orders which would continue the cycle over and over again until the counting/indexing system in the protocol is compromised. 




### Root Cause

- The choice to assign borrowIndexes from 0 rather than 1.
