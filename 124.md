# Absence of `minAnswer`/`maxAnswer` in the `DebitaChainlink` oracle

### Summary

Absence of `minAnswer`/`maxAnswer` in the [`DebitaChainlink`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L7) oracle can lead to big ratio miscalculations in the `DebitaV3Aggregator` contract. In the documentation of chainlink it is stated that such values are no longer used and they can't limit the protocol that is using the feeds. A thing they missed to mention is that this is not the case on Arbitrum and for the most feeds such as ETH and most stablecoin, such values are indeed used. this can be seen here on the [ETH/USD](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3607e46698d218B3a5Cae44bF381475C0a5e2ca7#readContract) (Will be used for WETH since WETH doesn't have it's own pricefeed) and [BTC/USD](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x942d00008D658dbB40745BBEc89A93c253f9B882#readContract) pricefeeds.

As stated in the Sherlock judging rules:
>Chainlink Price Checks: Issues related to minAnswer and maxAnswer checks on Chainlink's Price Feeds are considered medium only if the Watson explicitly mentions the price feeds (e.g. USDC/ETH) that require this check.
>
On Arbitrum, most of the feeds have this `minAnswer/maxAnswer` problem and since there is no feed for WETH, which will be used as stated [here](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1305706586764742750/1307789726341664839)(the ETH/USD feed will be used), this issue should be considered valid! 
### Root Cause

Absence of `minAnswer`/`maxAnswer` checks

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

Big market move which will make the price go bellow or above the borders

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If the price of an asset go bellow or above those borders, the users of the protocol can take advantage and call functions on higher/lower price than the actual one

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add such checks
