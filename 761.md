# DebitaIncentives::updateFunds Does Not Check All validPairs

### Summary

The `updateFunds` function is called by the aggregator contract to update the user's funds and the total principal amount. However, the function **prematurely returns** before iterating through all `validPairs`, potentially leaving valid updates unprocessed.

### Root Cause

The updateFunds function assumes that the input pairs (lendOrders) are always provided in the correct order. If they are not, the function returns prematurely, failing to update the storage for all valid pairs.
Relevant code:
[DebitaIncentives.sol#L317](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L317)

### Internal pre-conditions

1. DBO and DLO avaiable

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A caller of DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3 can deliberately structure the lendOrders argument so that the first entry does not correspond to a validPair.

2. This causes updateFunds to return early, denying lenders and borrowers the opportunity to earn additional rewards.

### Impact

* Lenders and borrowers lose the chance to earn additional rewards due to incomplete updates of valid pairs.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the premature return statement with a continue statement to ensure all pairs are checked:

```solidity
            if (!validPair) {
                continue;
            }
```
