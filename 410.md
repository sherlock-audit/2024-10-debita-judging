# function `changeOwner` in some protocol will not work properly

### Summary

In protocol `buyOrderFactory.sol`, `AuctionFactory.sol`, `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol`, the function `changeOwner` will not work properly.

### Root Cause

for example, at  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```
The function parameter has the same name of global var name in protocol. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L198
The `owner = owner` will not change the value of global var. So `msg.sender` will not change the owner. 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The ower of protocol will not able to change the owner, which break the functionaly of protocol. 

### PoC

```solidity
    function testBuyOrder() public {        
        BuyOrder instanceDeployment = new BuyOrder();
        factory = new buyOrderFactory(address(instanceDeployment));
        assertEq(factory.owner(), factory_owner); 
        vm.prank(factory_owner);
        factory.changeOwner(owner1);
        assertEq(factory.owner(), owner1); 
    }
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address new_owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = new_owner;
    }
```
