# Variable shadowing in multiple contracts causes changeOwner() to malfunction

### Summary

The function `changeOwner(address owner)` is not working correctly due to a clash between the parameter `address owner` and the variable `address public owner` in `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol` and `AuctionFactory.sol` and `buyOrderFactory.sol`. The locally assigned parameter takes precedence, therefore the ownership is not transferred.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol` the `address public owner` variable is shadowed by the `changeOwner(address owner)` function parameter, because both variables share the exact same name.
```solidity
function changeOwner(address owner) public {
   require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
   require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
   owner = owner;
}
```
Code locations:
`address public owner`

`changeOwner(address owner)`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682

Same issues in `AuctionFactory.sol` and `buyOrderFactory.sol`:

### Internal pre-conditions

No preconditions required. 

### External pre-conditions

No preconditions required. 

### Attack Path

1. Owner calls `changeOwner(address owner)` with intended new owner's address as parameter
2. Function call fails because the variable shadowing causes the `require(msg.sender == owner, ...)` check to fail
3. Even if msg.sender submits his own address to bypass the require statement, the final assignment will do nothing as the owner variable is assigned locally

### Impact

Initial owner will not be able to set new owner. The sponsor confirmed in a private thread that they intend to transfer ownership to a multisig after deployment, therefore this action will fail.

### PoC

```solidity
function testChangeOwner() public {
   address originalOwner = DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner();
   address wannabeOwner = address(0x1234);
   vm.startPrank(originalOwner);
   DebitaV3AggregatorContract.changeOwner(wannabeOwner);
   vm.stopPrank();
   assertEq(DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner(), originalOwner);
}
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
function changeOwner(address _owner) public { // change parameter name to _owner
   require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner"); 
   require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
   owner = _owner; // change right side of the assignment
}
```
