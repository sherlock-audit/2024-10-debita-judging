# DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3 incorrectly transfers collateral from itself

### Summary

DebitaV3Aggregator transfers collateral from itself to the loan contract .The issue with this is that the collateral is not held by the aggregator contract but by the BorrowOffer contract.


### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3` the loan collateral is transfered from the aggregator contract to the loan contract as seen here
the issue is that the aggregator contract does not hold the collateral for the loan.
The loan collateral is held by the BorrowOffer contract as we see here in the `DBOFactory::createBorrowOffer` function
