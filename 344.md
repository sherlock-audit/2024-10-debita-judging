# In certain scenarios borrowers will pay more fees for extending their loans than they are supposed to.

### Summary

The ``DebitaV3Loan.sol`` contract allows borrowers to extend their loan by calling the [extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function, which calculates several fees, including a fee that has to be paid to the DebitaFianance team for extending the loan for a certain time: 
```solidity
    function extendLoan() public {
        ...
        // calculate fees to pay to us
        uint feePerDay = Aggregator(AggregatorContract).feePerDay();
        uint minFEE = Aggregator(AggregatorContract).minFEE();
        uint maxFee = Aggregator(AggregatorContract).maxFEE();
        uint PorcentageOfFeePaid = ((m_loan.initialDuration * feePerDay) /
            86400);
        // adjust fees

        if (PorcentageOfFeePaid > maxFee) {
            PorcentageOfFeePaid = maxFee;
        } else if (PorcentageOfFeePaid < minFEE) {
            PorcentageOfFeePaid = minFEE;
        }

        // calculate interest to pay to Debita and the subtract to the lenders

        for (uint i; i < m_loan._acceptedOffers.length; i++) {
                ...
                if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
                    // calculate difference from fee paid for the initialDuration vs the extra fee they should pay because of the extras days of extending the loan.  MAXFEE shouldnt be higher than extra fee + PorcentageOfFeePaid
@here ->     uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) / 86400); 
                    if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
                        feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
                    } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) {
                        feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
                    }

                    misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
                }
                uint principleAmount = offer.principleAmount;
                uint feeAmount = (principleAmount * misingBorrowFee) / 10000;

                SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                    IERC20(offer.principle),
                    msg.sender,
                    address(this),
                    interestOfUsedTime - interestToPayToDebita
                );

                SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                    IERC20(offer.principle),
                    msg.sender,
                    feeAddress,
                    interestToPayToDebita + feeAmount
                );

                ...
            }
        }
        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));
    }
```
When a borrower creates a borrow order, he sets a duration which is the initial duration of the loan. The Lenders set a min and max duration, in order for the borrow order and lend orders to be matched the duration set by the borrower has to be between the min and max durations specified by the lender. However when the borrow and lend offers are matched, the ``offer.maxDeadline`` set for each offer is the sum of the current block.timestamp and the maxDuration specified by the lender, as can be seen on the following line in the [DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L511) function. Now as can be seen from the above code snippet when ``feeOfMaxDeadline`` is calculated it will divide the block.timestamp of the loan creation + the maxDuration specified by the lender, by 86_400 seconds(1 day), which will results in hundreds of days that have to be multiplied by a certain fee. It is true that the fee is capped, however the borrower will still have to pay more fees than he is supposed to, for a loan extension part of which he won't  be able to use, as the loan will be liquidated. Consider the following example:
 - Borrower A creates a borrow offer with a duration of 10 days
 - Lenders B, and C create lending offers with a max duration of 15 days
 - When the orders are matched the initial loan duration is set to 10 days, now the maximum duration the borrower can extend to is 15 days. However if he calls the [extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function, he will have to pay for 20 days.  Essentially overpaying for 5 days, which he can't utilize. Depending on the amounts of the loan this may result in significant loses for the borrower.
 
There are also parameters controlled by the admins of the protocol that can amplify the losses. For example the ``feePerDay`` is initially set to 4, the ``maxFEE`` is initially set to 80, so by dividing 80/4 we see that of now the borrower can be taxed for a 20 day loan at max. However those values can be changed by the admins of the protocol. For example the ``maxFEE`` can be set from 50 to 100 in the [DebitaV3Aggregator::setNewMaxFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L664-L668) function. The ``feePerDay`` can be set from 1 to 10 in the [setNewFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L658-L662) function. Essentially a borrower may have to overpay for up to ~90 days of fees, without having the chance to use the extended time properly. If we go back to the example above, if the loan is extended and the borrower pays for 10 additions days, after 15 days have passed the lenders can liquidate the loan by claiming the collateral. 


### Root Cause

In the [extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function, the fee that has to be paid by the borrower to the Debita team is calculated based on the sum of the block.timestamp of the loan creation, and the maxDuration specified by the lender, instead of just the maxDuration.

### Attack Path

No attack path, this is how the protocol functions

### Impact

Borrowers that want to extend their loans will pay much more fees to the Debita finance team than they are supposed to, and won't get the extension of the loan duration they are overpaying for. Keep in mind that loans in the Debita protocol are liquidated only when a certain amount of time has passed. As mentioned in the summary section, the amount, duration and certain parameters of the protocol may amplify the loses suffered by the borrower.
