# changeOwner() function doesn't work

### Summary

The same parameter name owner in the changeOwner() function as the state variable owner will cause a potential ownership change failure for the new owner as the current owner will fail to update the state variable, leaving the old owner with control.

### Root Cause

The same parameter name owner as the state variable owner is a mistake as it causes a conflict in the changeOwner() function.

```diff
+    function changeOwner(address owner_) public {
        // @audit owner is local variable - can't change owner
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
+        owner = owner_;
    }
