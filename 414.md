# M-4: The `buyOrderFactory::_deleteBuyOrder` allows an attacker to delete the `buyOrder` records of any other user on the contract due to access control issues.

### Summary

The function `buyOrderFactory::_deleteBuyOrder` allows an attacker to delete the buyOrder records of any other user on the contract due to access control issues. This is because the function only verifies the existence of the buyOrder and ignores the fact that a buyOrder should only be deletable by its owner.

### Root Cause

In [buyOrderFactory::_deleteBuyOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L127-L137), there is an access control issue that allows an attacker to delete the buyOrder records of any other user on the contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates a legitimate buyOrder, which sets `isBuyOrderLegit[attacker] = true`.
2. The attacker can then call `_deleteBuyOrder(victimAddress)`.
3. This allows the attacker to delete the buyOrder of any other user.

### Impact

The attacker can create a valid buyOrder and then delete the buyOrder records of other users on the contract.

### PoC

A simplified POC demonstrating the impact. It needs to be run in Remix.

User A: 0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4  
User B: 0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2

1. When User A deploys the contract and calls `deposit()`, they can then call `test()` to execute related actions.  
2. At this point, if User B also calls `deposit()`, `isVaultValid[msg.sender] = true;` will be set, and User B can successfully call `test()` to execute related actions as well.  
3. In a real-world scenario, this would allow a malicious user to create a valid buyOrder and then call `buyOrderFactory::_deleteBuyOrder` to delete the buyOrders created by other users!

pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

contract HelloWorld {
    mapping(address => bool) internal isVaultValid;
    modifier onlyVault() {
        require(isVaultValid[msg.sender], "not vault");
        _;
    }

    function deposit() external {
        isVaultValid[msg.sender] = true;
    }

    function test() external onlyVault{
        // ... Call Success
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

It is recommended to add `msg.sender == _buyOrder` for further validation.

```diff
    function _deleteBuyOrder(address _buyOrder) public onlyBuyOrder {
+     require(msg.sender == _buyOrder, "Can only delete own order");
        uint index = BuyOrderIndex[_buyOrder];
        BuyOrderIndex[_buyOrder] = 0;

        allActiveBuyOrders[index] = allActiveBuyOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1];
        allActiveBuyOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

        BuyOrderIndex[allActiveBuyOrders[index]] = index;

        activeOrdersCount--;
    }
```
