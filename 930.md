```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```
 The `owner` local variable shadows the `owner` state variable , so the state variable `owner` is never updated.
