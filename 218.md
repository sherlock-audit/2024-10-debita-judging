# [H-7] The `hasBeenIndexedBribe` mapping prevents the bribe token from being indexed for different `principles` within the same `epoch`

### Summary

The `DebitaIncentives::incentivizePair` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L225) is designed to allow users to incentivize lending or borrowing for specific `principles` in future `epochs`. Users should be able to call this function multiple times for the same `principle`, `incentivizeToken`, and `epoch` to increase the total incentives.

The mapping `hasBeenIndexedBribe` is used to track whether an `incentivizeToken` has been indexed for an `epoch` or not `mapping(uint => mapping(address => bool)) public hasBeenIndexedBribe;`.

The condition in the code is
```javascript
if (!hasBeenIndexedBribe[epoch][incentivizeToken]) {
    //..
    //..
    hasBeenIndexedBribe[epoch][incentivizeToken] = true;
}
```

The problem arises when someone attempts to use the same `incentivizeToken` for two different `principle` tokens in the same epoch. Imagine that we two different tokens (A and B) inside the same epoch, and we want to incentivize both tokens with `USDC`. After incentivizing token A, this will set `hasBeenIndexedBribe[epoch][incentivizeToken] = true;` meaning that some token within this epoch was incentivized with USDC.

When we attempt to also incentivize token B with the same USDC inside the same epoch, because `hasBeenIndexedBribe[epoch][incentivizeToken]` is already true, this whole code block will be skipped for token B

```javascript
            if (!hasBeenIndexedBribe[epoch][incentivizeToken]) {
                uint lastAmount = bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch[epoch][principle];
                SpecificBribePerPrincipleOnEpoch[epoch][hashVariables(principle, lastAmount)] = incentivizeToken;
                bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch[epoch][incentivizeToken]++;
                hasBeenIndexedBribe[epoch][incentivizeToken] = true;
            }
```

and token B will not have its bribes properly updated for this epoch anymore.

### Root Cause

When the same `incentivizeToken` is used for different `principles` in the same `epoch`, the `hasBeenIndexedBribe` mapping prevents the bribe token from being indexed for the new `principle`.

This is because `hasBeenIndexedBribe[epoch][incentivizeToken]` is already `true` after the first indexing, regardless of the `principle`. As a result, the bribe token is not associated with the new `principle`, causing functions like `getBribesPerEpoch` to miss it which can lead to incorrect incentive distribution logic.

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Inaccurate Incentive Distribution:

1. Users incentivizing different principles with the same `incentivizeToken` in the same epoch will not have their bribe tokens properly indexed.
2. Users will not receive the correct incentives as the bribe counts per principle are inaccurate (potential loss of funds for users). 
3. The `DebitaIncentives::getBribesPerEpoch` function, which depends on `bribeCountPerPrincipleOnEpoch` to retrieve bribe information, will return incorrect data as not all the bribe tokens are properly recorded.

### PoC

Not needed.

### Mitigation

This is just an idea of how a fix could be implemented.
Modify `hasBeenIndexedBribe` mapping to also include `principle`.

```diff
-   // epoch => incentive token => bool has been indexed
-   mapping(uint => mapping(address => bool)) public hasBeenIndexedBribe;

+ // epoch => principle => incentivizeToken => bool has been indexed
+ mapping(uint => mapping(address => mapping(address => bool))) public hasBeenIndexedBribe;
```

Update Condition in `incentivizePair` function:

```diff
+ if (!hasBeenIndexedBribe[epoch][principle][incentivizeToken]) {
+    // Indexing logic
+    hasBeenIndexedBribe[epoch][principle][incentivizeToken] = true;
}
```
Including `principle` in the mapping allows the same `incentivizeToken` to be properly indexed for different principles in the same epoch.

Update the rest of the logic accordingly.
