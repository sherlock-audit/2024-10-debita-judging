# Insufficient checks to confirm the correct status of `sequencerUptimeFeed` in `DebitaChainlink.sol`

### Summary

The missing check for a `0` value in `sequencerUptimeFeed.startedAt` will cause inaccurate sequencer status validation for the Debita platform as `getThePrice()` will pass incorrectly when `startedAt` is `0` and answer is also `0`, failing to validate the sequencer status effectively.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaChainlink.sol:61](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/376fec45be95bd4bbc929fd37b485076b03ab8b0/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L61), the lack of a `startedAt != 0` check in `checkSequencer()` fails to confirm an updated sequencer status during invalid rounds.

Making sure `startedAt` isn't `0` is crucial for keeping the system secure and properly informed about the sequencer's status.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `checkSequencer()` to be called within `getThePrice()`.
2. `sequencerUptimeFeed` to have both answer and `startedAt` set to `0`.

### External pre-conditions

1. experiencing a brief downtime with delayed updates in Chainlink's L2 uptime feed.
2. Invalid round leading to a `startedAt` value of 0.

### Attack Path

1. The sequencer feed returns `answer == 0` and `startedAt == 0` due to invalid round.
2. `checkSequencer()` executes without `startedAt` check, passing verification even though sequencer status is unconfirmed.

### Impact

Debita suffers an approximate security vulnerability, as the contract mistakenly assumes sequencer uptime, exposing protocol to outdated or incorrect oracle data.

### PoC

A recent [pull request](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/documentation/pull/1995) to update theÂ [chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds)

### Mitigation

Add a `require(startedAt != 0, "Invalid sequencer status");` check in `checkSequencer()`.

    // Check if the sequencer is up
    bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
    if (!isSequencerUp) {
        revert SequencerDown();
    }

+   // Ensure that startedAt is valid and non-zero
+   require(startedAt != 0, "Invalid sequencer status");

    // Calculate the time since the sequencer came back up
    uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
    if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
        revert GracePeriodNotOver();
    }

    return true;
}
