# Owner unable to transfer ownership due to incorrect variable assignment in `changeOwner` function

### Summary

The incorrect variable assignment in the `changeOwner` function will cause an inability to change the owner of the contract. This happens because the function assigns the parameter to itself instead of updating the state variable, preventing the owner from transferring ownership within the allowed time frame.

### Root Cause

In the `changeOwner` function at the following locations:
[`DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:682`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682)
[`AuctionFactory.sol:218`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218)
[`buyOrderFactory.sol:186`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186)

the parameter `owner` shadows the state variable `owner`. The assignment `owner = owner; `incorrectly assigns the parameter to itself, leaving the state variable `owner` unchanged.

### Internal pre-conditions

The current owner calls `changeOwner` with the intention to transfer ownership to a new address.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The owner attempts to transfer ownership by calling `changeOwner` with the new owner's address.
2. Due to the incorrect assignment (`owner = owner;`), the state variable `owner` remains the same.
3. After 6 hours from deployment, the owner cannot attempt to change ownership again due to the time restriction which makes the issue even more severe.

### Impact

The owner is unable to transfer ownership of the contract, potentially locking administrative control permanently. This prevents any future administrative updates, upgrades, or the ability to relinquish control, which could have severe implications for contract maintenance and security.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Rename the function parameter to `newOwner` and update the assignment to correctly reflect the intended behavior:
```solidity
function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = newOwner;
}
```
