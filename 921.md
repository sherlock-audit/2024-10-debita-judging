# Unused variable `implementationContract` in `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol`

### Summary

In the `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol` contract contains an `implementationContract` variable that is initialized
in the constructor but never used elsewhere in the contract. This unused variable suggests a deviation form the intended
use of the proxy pattern for deploying the `DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol` contract. The root cause appears to be the 
omission of the proxy deployment mechanism, leading to issues with the contract`s upgradeability.

### Root Cause

In the [DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol:48](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L48) the variable is set in the constructor but never used elsewhere in the contract.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

**Loss of upgradeability**
- Inability to upgrade logic: Without using the proxy pattern individual `DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol` instances cannot be upgraded by changing the implementation contract address in the `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol` contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `crateBorrowOrder` function to deploy a proxy contract for the `DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol` contract.
```javascript
function createBorrowOrder(/*parameters*/) external returns (address) {
    // ...

    DebitaProxyContract borrowOfferProxy = new DebitaProxyContract(
        implementationContract
    );
    
    DBOImplementation borrowOffer = DBOImplementation(address(borrowOfferProxy));

    borrowOffer.initialize(
        aggregatorContract,
        msg.sender,
        // other parameters
    );

    // ...
}
```
