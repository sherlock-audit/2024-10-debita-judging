# `BorrowOfferFactory` doesn't use the `implementation` address to create a `BorrowOfferImplemetation`

### Summary

`BorrowOfferFactory` doesn't use the `implementation` address to create a `BorrowOfferImplemetation`. As seen in basically every other factory in the system, accept `AuctionFactory`(because it is created by constructor), does use the `DebitaProxyContract` to create the implementations. The intended behaviour with `BorrowOfferFactory` is the same as the `DebitaProxyContract` is imported and an implementation address is inputed in the constructor. This can lead to impossibility to upgrade the implementation contract.

### Root Cause

the `BorrowOrderImplementation` is not deployed by using the [`DebitaProxyContract`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaProxyContract.sol#L4)

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The implementation can't be upgraded and the intend here is clearly to deploy it via `DebitaProxyContract` since it's counterpart (`LendOrderImplementation`) is deployed via `DebitaProxyContract`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Deploy the `BorrowOrderImplementation` via `DebitaProxyContract`
