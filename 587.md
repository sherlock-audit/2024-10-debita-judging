# incorrect time calculation in extendloan

### Summary

while calculating the duration the borrower is extending his loan for the time foer the extended period is calculated as

the cfunction first computes the time that has passed by subtracting the loan started timestamp with current timestamp

                uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;

but then the function incorrectly subtracts block.timestamp while calculating the extended time

                uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline -
                    alreadyUsedTime -
                    block.timestamp;

### PoC

Loan start date: 1st November 2024 (Unix timestamp:1730439879 ).
Current date (block.timestamp): 24th November 2024 (Unix timestamp:1732446879 )
loan max duration 1 dec (unix timestamp:1733031879 )

already used timestamp :1732446879-1730439879=2007000

   uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline -
                    alreadyUsedTime -
                    block.timestamp;

offermaxdeadline: 1733031879 - 2007000 - 1732446879 = -1422000

because the block.timestamp is subtracted this value this will give a negative value and underflow




### Mitigation

dont subtract the block.timestamp while calculating the extended time
