# Protocol does not take into consideration `ERC20` tokens with blacklist functions like `USDC` and `USDT`

### Summary

There is a chance for the Collateral token to be stuck in the protocol forever. This can happen to tokens with blacklist functionality, like the `USDC` and `USDT` token. 

### Root Cause

In the [`claimCollateralAsLender`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L340) function the transaction to send the collateral to the lender will always revert if the lender is blacklisted by collateral token. The transaction will always revert, and the tokens will be stuck in the protocol forever.
