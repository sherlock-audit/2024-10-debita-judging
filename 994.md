# overshadowing in auction factory change owner

### Summary

    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    } 
    
    the function tries to set the state variable owner to the specified owner, however the owner memory variable overshadows the owner storage variable meaning owner is set to itself and the owner variable is not actually updated
