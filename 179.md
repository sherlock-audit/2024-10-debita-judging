# buyOrder:sellNFT() transfers NFT to contract itself instead of transferring to owner

### Summary

buyOrder:sellNFT() transfers NFT to contract itself instead of transferring to owner

### Root Cause

[sellNFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L99C2-L103C11)() takes wanted NFT from the msg.sender and transfers them the buyToken. The problem is, wanted NFT is transferred to contract itself instead of transferring to buyOrder owner.
```solidity
    function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
...

        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
@>          address(this),
            receiptID
        );
...

    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

This will happen everytime when a user will call sellNFT()

### Impact

Owner will lose his NFT permanently because there is no way to claim/withdraw his NFT

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use owner's address instead of address(this)
```diff
    function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
...

        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
-           address(this),
+           buyInformation.owner
            receiptID
        );
...

    }
```
