# The `sellNFT` function transfers the NFT to the `buyOrder.sol` contract instead of the buyer.

### Summary

The `sellNFT` function transfers the receipt veNFT to the `buyOrder.sol` contract instead of to the buyer (buyInformation.owner). This results in the buyer losing his receipt veNFT, and the receipt veNFT will be permanently lost after the buy order is deleted.
```solidity
        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
101:        address(this),
            receiptID
        );
```

+           buyInformation.owner,
            receiptID
        );
```
