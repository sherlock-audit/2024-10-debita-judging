# The `auctionFactoryDebita::changeOwner` fails to change owner as it should

## Impact
### Summary 
The `auctionFactoryDebita::changeOwner` is designed to change the owner of the `auctionFactoryDebita` contract, passing owner privileges from the old owner to the new owner. However, this function will not be able to change the `owner` of the contract due to conflicting variable naming convention. 

### Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability of this function lies in the fact that the name of the input parameter for the `auctionFactoryDebita::changeOwner` function conflicts with the storage variable `owner` in the sense that the two variables are not differentiated.
Here is the link to the function in question https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/auctionFactoryDebita.sol#L218-L222 and also shown in the code snippet below

```javascript
@>  function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```

### Impact
As a result of this conflicting variable naming convention, the solidity compiler fumbles in when to user `owner` as the parameter input of the `auctionFactoryDebita::changeOwner` function and when to use `owner` as state varable in the `auctionFactoryDebita` contract. 
In particular, if the `auctionFactoryDebita::changeOwner` function is called by the `auctionFactoryDebita::owner`, the call reverts due to the first require statement. This is because `msg.sender` is compared against `owner`, the parameter input instead of `auctionFactoryDebita::owner`. On the other hand, if `owner` as in the input parameter calls the `auctionFactoryDebita::changeOwner` function, the function executes but owner is not changed.
Hence, the owner cannot be changed, breaking the protocol's functionality.

## Proof of Concept
Note that `auctionFactoryDebita::owner` is an internal variable and the `auctionFactoryDebita` contract has no getter function for `auctionFactoryDebita::owner`. In order for us to view `auctionFactoryDebita::owner`, we create a similar contract that inherits the `auctionFactoryDebita` contract and in addition, we construct a getter function for the `auctionFactoryDebita::owner` variable.
1. Create another contract `FactoryOwnerViewer` inside `Auction.t.sol`. This contract should inherit `auctionFactoryDebita` contract, and have a getter function for  `auctionFactoryDebita::owner` in addition.
2. Prank the owner of `FactoryOwnerViewer` to call the `FactoryOwnerViewer::changeOwner` function which reverts with `Only owner` message.
3. Prank the address we wish to set as the new owner to call the `FactoryOwnerViewer::changeOwner` function. This executes successfully but using the getter function shows that the `FactoryOwnerViewer::owner` has not changed.

<summary>PoC</summary>
Place the following code into `Auction.t.sol`.

```javascript
contract FactoryOwnerViewer is auctionFactoryDebita {
    

    function getFactoryOwner() public view returns(address) {
        return owner;
    }

}

contract FactoryOwnerViewerTest is Test {
    FactoryOwnerViewer factoryViewer;

    function setUp() external {
        factoryViewer = new FactoryOwnerViewer();

    }

    function test_SpomariaPoC_AuctionFactoryCantChangeOwner() public {

        // address factoryOwner = factory.owner();
        address factoryOwner = factoryViewer.getFactoryOwner();

        address _newFactoryOwner = makeAddr("new_owner");

        vm.startPrank(factoryOwner);
        vm.expectRevert("Only owner");
        factoryViewer.changeOwner(_newFactoryOwner);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(_newFactoryOwner);
        factoryViewer.changeOwner(_newFactoryOwner);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // assert that owner was not changed
        assertEq(factoryViewer.getFactoryOwner(), factoryOwner);
    }
}
```

Now run `forge test --match-test test_SpomariaPoC_AuctionFactoryCantChangeOwner -vvvv`

Output:
```javascript

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider changing the name of the input parameter of the `auctionFactoryDebita::changeOwner` function in such a way that it does not conflict with any state variables. For instance, we could use `address _owner` instead of `address owner` as shown below:

```diff
-   function changeOwner(address owner) public {
+   function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
-       owner = owner;
+       owner = _owner;
    }
```
