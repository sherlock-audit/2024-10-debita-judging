# Oracle does not verify Pyth's published confidence interval

### Attack Path

The price data returned from Pyth consists of the confidence interval. Refer to the Pyth documentation [here](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals) and [here](https://www.pyth.network/blog/what-is-confidence) for more details.

However, the `DebitaPyth` oracle was found not performing any validation against the returned confidence interval. As a result, prices that are extremely uncertain and might deviate significantly from the actual market price could be used with the protocol.

As a result, the calculated price/ratio will be inflated or deflated. When the price/ratio of collateral/principle tokens is incorrect, more or less collateral/principle tokens within the lending/borrow offers will be matched, resulting in a loss for the lender or borrower.

For instance, if the collateral price within the borrow offer is inflated, the protocol will assume that the borrow offer contains collateral that is worth much more than expected and allow them to borrow more principle than expected from the lenders, resulting in a loss for the affected lenders.

35:         );

38:         require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");

### Impact

High. Loss of assets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Let $\sigma$ be the aggregate price and $\mu$ be aggregate confidence, which is similar to to symbol used within the [documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals)

The documentation highlighted that one could compute the ratio $\frac{\sigma}{\mu}$ (the opposite is fine too $\frac{\mu}{\sigma}$), and if the ratio exceeds some threshold, one can choose to pause any new activity that depends on the price of this asset if there is too much uncertainty in the price returned.
