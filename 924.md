# DebitaIncentives: Uses transfer() instead of safeTransfer() which can result in locked incentive tokens

### Summary

In DebitaIncentives.sol, users can claim their rewards/ incentives via the `claimIncentives()` function

- This functions uses unsafe ERC20 `transfer()` without return value checking, which could cause loss of incentives and incorrect claim status for users as failed transfers will not revert but still mark incentives as claimed

### Root Cause

In `claimIncentives():`
- the state variable tracking user's claim is updated BEFORE the token transfer happens. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L196-L198
- The contract uses `transfer()` instead of `safeTransfer()` for ERC20 token transfers without checking the return value

Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) don't conform to the standard and don't return boolean values. This results in transfer failures not being properly handled, leading to **state changes even when transfers fail**. 

### Internal pre-conditions

- Users have accrued rewards for the specified epoch and rewards tokens
- The rewards token does not return a bool value on `transfer()` (USDT)

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Users permanently lose their incentives as they are marked as claimed without actually receiving tokens
- Incentives become permanently locked in contract
