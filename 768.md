# Borrowers Bear the 15% Protocol Fee While Lenders Are Exempted

### Summary

The [documentation](https://debita-finance.gitbook.io/debita-v3/overview/fees#loans) stated the following:
> Lender will pay 15% on the interest paid by the borrower.

It is implemented incorrectly where borrower pays the 15% instead.

### Root Cause

The `DebitaV3Loan::payDebt` function is used to repay the loan along with interest. The additional 15% fee was charged to `msg.sender` (the borrower) rather than the lender contract. As a result, the 15% fee is applied each time a debt is repaid, with the lenders remaining unaffected by the charge.

```solidity
    function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
            -- SNIP --
            uint interest = calculateInterestToPay(index);
            uint feeOnInterest = (interest * feeLender) / 10000;
            uint total = offer.principleAmount + interest - feeOnInterest;
            address currentOwnerOfOffer;

            try ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) returns (
                address _lenderOwner
            ) {
                currentOwnerOfOffer = _lenderOwner;
            } catch {}

            DLOImplementation lendOffer = DLOImplementation(offer.lendOffer);
            DLOImplementation.LendInfo memory lendInfo = lendOffer
                .getLendInfo();

            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                IERC20(offer.principle),
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                total
            );
            // if the lender is the owner of the offer and the offer is perpetual, then add the funds to the offer
            if (lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer) {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
                IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);
                lendOffer.addFunds(total);
            } else {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim =
                    interest -
                    feeOnInterest;
            }

            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                IERC20(offer.principle),
                msg.sender, //@audit-issue
                feeAddress,
                feeOnInterest
            );
            -- SNIP --

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Borrowers pay an additional 15% in interest, while lenders are able to bypass the fees that would normally be paid to the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is possible that the lender's contract does not have the tokens to pay the debt. Hence, remove the following snippet within the `DebitaV3Loan::payDebt()` and ``DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan()`, and include the fee payment logic to feeAddress within `DebitaV3Loan::claimDebt`.
