# Users may face unfair liquidation after the L2 Sequencer grace period.

### Summary

User might be unfairly liquidated after L2 Sequencer grace period.

### Root Cause

The protocol implements a L2 sequencer downtime check in the [checkSequencer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L49C14-L49C28)  In the event of sequencer downtime (as well as a grace period following recovery), liquidations are disabled for the rightful reasons.

```solidity

 if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert SequencerDown();  <@
        }
        console.logUint(startedAt);
        // Make sure the grace period has passed after the
        // sequencer is back up.
        uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
        if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
            revert GracePeriodNotOver();   <@
        }

```

At the same time, user won't be able to create order nor any order can be filled. This is problematic because when the `Arbitrum` sequencer is down and then comes back up, all `Chainlink` price updates will become available on `Arbitrum` within a very short time. This leaves users no time to react to the price changes which can lead to unfair liquidations.

Even if deposit is still allowed during the grace period, it is unfair to the user as they are forced to do so, not to mention that some users may not have enough funds to deposit.

### Mitigation

Order should be allowed to be created and filled during sequencer grace period, this can be achieved by skippingÂ `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME` checking.


```solidity
 function getThePrice(address tokenAddress,  bool skipGracePeriodChecking) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer(skipGracePeriodChecking);
        }
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```

```solidity
function checkSequencer(bool skipGracePeriodChecking) public view returns (bool) {
    (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, , ) = sequencerUptimeFeed.latestRoundData();

    // Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
    // Answer == 1: Sequencer is down
    bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
    if (!isSequencerUp) {
        revert SequencerDown();
    }

    uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
    // Conditionally skip the grace period check
    if (!skipGracePeriodChecking && timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
        revert GracePeriodNotOver();
    }

    return true;
}
