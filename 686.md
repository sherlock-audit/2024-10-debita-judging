# Collateral Seizure Failure Due to Deterministic Address Exploit in Borrower Contract Deployment

### Summary

The protocol facilitates borrowing through the deployment of new borrower contracts (``DBOImplementation``) via the ``DBOFactory::createBorrowOrder`` function. While the system attempts to restrict the use of fee-on-transfer (FOT) tokens, the deterministic address generation for deployed contracts inadvertently allows attackers to bypass these restrictions. Malicious borrowers can pre-fund the precomputed contract addresses with FOT tokens, ensuring balance checks are satisfied despite protocol safeguards.

This exploit causes a discrepancy between the protocol's internal accounting and actual token balances, leading to locked collateral. As a result, lenders are unable to reclaim their collateral when borrowers default. This creates systemic inefficiencies in liquidation processes, potentially resulting in significant financial losses for both the protocol and its users.

### Root Cause

The use of the ``CREATE`` opcode for deploying ``DBOImplementation`` contracts results in deterministic address generation based on the factory's current nonce. This predictability allows malicious actors to compute future contract addresses and exploit this knowledge by pre-funding these addresses with FOT tokens before deployment.

Relevant code:
[DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L106](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L106)

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- The attacker must monitor the factory contract's nonce, which is publicly accessible via blockchain explorers.
- The attacker must compute the address of the next borrower contract using the formula:
predictedAddress = keccak256(rlp(DBOFactoryAddress, nonce))

### Attack Path

The attack begins with the malicious actor monitoring the nonce of the ``DBOFactory`` contract, which is easily obtainable via block explorers. By calculating the address of the next borrow offer contract using the formula ``address = keccak256(rlp(senderAddress, nonce))``, the attacker precomputes the address of the next borrower contract to be deployed.

Before the deployment of the new borrow offer contract, the attacker sends a predetermined amount of fee-on-transfer (FOT) tokens directly to the calculated address. This ensures that, despite the transfer fees deducted by the token, the resulting balance is sufficient to pass the protocolâ€™s validation checks.

To further exploit the system, the attacker sends an extra amount of the FOT token to the ``DebitaV3Aggregator`` contract. This additional amount compensates for the fees charged during the token transfer from their borrower contract to the aggregator upon matching the offer.

The malicious borrow offer is then matched with a lend order where lenders, unaware of the pre-funded FOT token setup, accept these tokens as collateral. Once the collateral is sent to the newly deployed ``DebitaV3Loan`` contract, additional fees are deducted, causing discrepancies in internal accounting.

As time passes and the borrower defaults without repayment, the lender attempts to seize the collateral. However, due to the precision mismatch and internal accounting errors caused by the exploit, the ``claimCollateralAsLender`` function fails to execute correctly. This leaves the lender unable to recover their funds, resulting in permanent financial loss.


### Impact

Financial Loss: Lenders face a permanent loss of funds, as they are unable to reclaim the collateral when borrowers default.

### PoC
```solidity
function claimCollateralAsLender(uint index) external nonReentrant {
        LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
        infoOfOffers memory offer = m_loan._acceptedOffers[index];
        IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);
        require(
            ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) == msg.sender,
            "Not lender"
        );
        // burn ownership
        ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID);
        uint _nextDeadline = nextDeadline();

        require(offer.paid == false, "Already paid");
        require(
            _nextDeadline < block.timestamp && _nextDeadline != 0,
            "Deadline not passed"
        );
        require(offer.collateralClaimed == false, "Already executed");

        // claim collateral
        if (m_loan.isCollateralNFT) {
            claimCollateralAsNFTLender(index);
        } else {
            loanData._acceptedOffers[index].collateralClaimed = true;
            uint decimals = ERC20(loanData.collateral).decimals();
            SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
                IERC20(loanData.collateral),
                msg.sender,
  @>>     (offer.principleAmount * (10 ** decimals)) / offer.ratio
            );
        }
        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));
    }
```

### Mitigation

Use CREATE2 with Random Salt: Replace the CREATE opcode with CREATE2 to make contract addresses unpredictable by incorporating a random salt during deployment.
