# M-3: Due to an incorrect implementation of the `for` loop in `buyOrderFactory::getActiveBuyOrders`, the function fails to return the correct query results.

### Summary

The purpose of the `buyOrderFactory::getActiveBuyOrders` function is to retrieve buy order information within a specified range. However, due to an incorrect implementation of the `for` loop, the function fails to return the correct query results, as the loop causes an out-of-bounds access to the `_activeBuyOrders` array.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    function getActiveBuyOrders(
        uint offset,
        uint limit
    ) public view returns (BuyOrder.BuyInfo[] memory) {
        uint length = limit;

        if (limit > activeOrdersCount) {
            length = activeOrdersCount;
        }

        BuyOrder.BuyInfo[] memory _activeBuyOrders = new BuyOrder.BuyInfo[](
            limit - offset
        );
        for (uint i = offset; i < offset + limit; i++) {
@>            address order = allActiveBuyOrders[i];
@>            _activeBuyOrders[i] = BuyOrder(order).getBuyInfo();
        }
        return _activeBuyOrders;
    }
```

In the [buyOrderFactory::getActiveBuyOrders](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L139-L157) function, there is an error in the implementation of the `for` loop, as the number of `orders` can exceed the length of the `_activeBuyOrders` array, leading to an out-of-bounds access.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `getHistoricalBuyOrders`
2. `getActiveBuyOrders`

Since `getHistoricalBuyOrders` has the same issue as `getActiveBuyOrders`, I only need to clearly describe the issue with `getActiveBuyOrders`.

### Impact

Due to an array out-of-bounds issue in the `for` loop in `buyOrderFactory::getActiveBuyOrders`, users are unable to receive the correct query results when calling this function.

### PoC

To demonstrate the impact based on the description in the Root Cause:

Scenario Simulation:

1. Set `offset = 1`, `limit = 5`, where `limit < activeOrdersCount`.
4. Therefore, `_activeBuyOrders.length = 4`.
5. The `for` loop is implemented as `uint i = offset; i < offset + limit; i++`.
6. This results in `1 <= i < 6`, meaning the loop will attempt to process 5 orders, while `_activeBuyOrders.length = 4`.
7. Since `4 < 5`, this causes an out-of-bounds access.

### Mitigation

The correct `for` loop can be implemented with the following modification:

```diff
    function getActiveBuyOrders(
        uint offset,
        uint limit
    ) public view returns (BuyOrder.BuyInfo[] memory) {
        uint length = limit;

        if (limit > activeOrdersCount) {
            length = activeOrdersCount;
        }

        BuyOrder.BuyInfo[] memory _activeBuyOrders = new BuyOrder.BuyInfo[](
            limit - offset
        );
-        for (uint i = offset; i < offset + limit; i++) {
+        for (uint i = 0; i + offset < length; i++) {
-            address order = allActiveBuyOrders[i];
+            address order = allActiveBuyOrders[i + offset];
            _activeBuyOrders[i] = BuyOrder(order).getBuyInfo();
        }
        return _activeBuyOrders;
    }
```
