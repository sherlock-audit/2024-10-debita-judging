# Malicious owner of lend order can delete all Lend Orders from LendOfferFactory contract's mapping.

### Summary

The [`DebitaLendOffer-Factory.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L49) contract is repsonsible for creating lend orders, these orders are stored on mappings `LendOrderIndex` and `allActiveLendOrders`. Due to an implementation logic issues, these mappings are vulnerable to manipulations from any lend order owner.

### Root Cause

In [`DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol:144`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L144) there is a function to cancel the offer that is meant to be called only once, but thats not the case. This function also calls the `deleteOrder` function of the factory contract which changes the `LendOrderIndex` and `allActiveLendOrders` mappings, also it is decrementing the `activeOrdersCount`.:

```solidity
157: IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
```

The `cancelOffer` requires that the `availableAmount` of lend offer to be greater than `0` for its execution. When the requieremnt is met the function sets the `isActive` to `false`, sends the `availableAmount` to the `msg.sender` and finally calls the `deleteOrder` of its factory.

The implementation contract also have `addFunds` function that gives the owner of the lend or the loan contract to add additional funds to the lend order:

```solidity
    function addFunds(uint amount) public nonReentrant {
        require(
            msg.sender == lendInformation.owner ||
                IAggregator(aggregatorContract).isSenderALoan(msg.sender),
            "Only owner or loan"
        );
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        lendInformation.availableAmount += amount;
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
    }
```

This function increments the `availableAmount` by the `amount` passed as parameter to the function. Since `availableAmount` is greater than `0` again, the `cancelOffer` is callable again by the owner of the lend, but the mappings of the factory contract are already changed with the first `cancelOffer` call. A secondary call will totally mess them, resulting in deleting lend orders of other lenders and decrementing `activeOrdersCount` again.


### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates a Lend Order .
2. Bob creates more 9 Lend Orders.
3. Alice cancels her offer.
4. Alice adds funds to her lend order contract.
5. Alice repeats `step 3` and `step 4` as many times as the number of total lends.
6. Alice ended up deleting all the lend orders from factory mapping.

After `step 2 ` there will be 10 lend orders - `activeOrdersCount = 10`.
After each `step 5` the `activeOrdersCount` variable will decrement by 1



### Impact

Assume the protocol has 100 lend orders each of them are properly indexed in the mappings and the `activeOrdersCount = 100`. The following exploit will mess the mappings and set the `activeOrdersCount` to `0`. This will potentially break the protocol usage by regular users, which will call the `getActiveOrders` of `DebitaLendOfferFactory` in order to match the orders on `DebitaV3Aggregator`. Although there are lend contracts deployed, the `DebitaLendOfferFactory` will lost their track failing to provide them to user.

Illustration with 10 created lend orders:

Address | LendOrderIndex |   | Index | allActiveLendOrders
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
addr1 | 0 |   | 0 | addr1
addr2 | 1 |   | 1 | addr2
addr3 | 2 |   | 2 | addr3
addr4 | 3 |   | 3 | addr4
addr5 | 4 |   | 4 | addr5
addr6 | 5 |   | 5 | addr6
addr7 | 6 |   | 6 | addr7
addr8 | 7 |   | 7 | addr8
addr9 | 8 |   | 8 | addr9
addr10 | 9 |   | 9 | addr10

activeOrdersCount = 10
Say we want to delete order with addr9, which has index 8:

Address | LendOrderIndex |   | Index | allActiveLendOrders
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
addr9 | 0 |   | 8 | addr10
addr10 | 8 |   | 9 | adress 0

Updated mappings will be

Address | LendOrderIndex |   | Index | allActiveLendOrders
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
addr1 | 0 |   | 0 | addr1
addr2 | 1 |   | 1 | addr2
addr3 | 2 |   | 2 | addr3
addr4 | 3 |   | 3 | addr4
addr5 | 4 |   | 4 | addr5
addr6 | 5 |   | 5 | addr6
addr7 | 6 |   | 6 | addr7
addr8 | 7 |   | 7 | addr8
addr9 | 0 |   | 8 | addr10
addr10 | 8 |   | 9 | adress 0

activeOrdersCount = 9
Again delete the order with addr9, which has index 0:

Address | LendOrderIndex |   | Index | allActiveLendOrders
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
addr9 | 0 |   | 0 | addr10
addr10 | 0 |   | 8 | adress 0

Updated mappings will be

Address | LendOrderIndex |   | Index | allActiveLendOrders
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
addr1 | 0 |   | 0 | addr10
addr2 | 1 |   | 1 | addr2
addr3 | 2 |   | 2 | addr3
addr4 | 3 |   | 3 | addr4
addr5 | 4 |   | 4 | addr5
addr6 | 5 |   | 5 | addr6
addr7 | 6 |   | 6 | addr7
addr8 | 7 |   | 7 | addr8
addr9 | 0 |   | 8 | adress 0
addr10 | 0 |   | 9 | adress 0

activeOrdersCount = 8
Again delete the order with adr9, which has index 0:

Address | LendOrderIndex |   | Index | allActiveLendOrders
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
adr9 | 0 |   | 0 | addr8
adr8 | 0 |   | 7 | adress 0

Updated mappings will be

Address | LendOrderIndex |   | Index | allActiveLendOrders
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
adr1 | 0 |   | 0 | addr8
adr2 | 1 |   | 1 | addr2
adr3 | 2 |   | 2 | addr3
adr4 | 3 |   | 3 | addr4
adr5 | 4 |   | 4 | addr5
adr6 | 5 |   | 5 | addr6
adr7 | 6 |   | 6 | addr7
adr8 | 0 |   | 7 | adress 0
adr9 | 0 |   | 8 | adress 0
adr10 | 0 |   | 9 | adress 0

activeOrdersCount = 7

And continues until all the indexes of `allActiveLendOrders` points to `address(0)`

### PoC

Create the following test [file](https://gist.github.com/ahmedovv123/1eeaf524e04e940409f7e4e788671cfc) and run it.

### Mitigation

Make sure that `isActive` is set to `true` whenever calling the `addFunds` function.

```diff
    function addFunds(uint amount) public nonReentrant {
+       require(isActive, "...");
        require(
            msg.sender == lendInformation.owner ||
                IAggregator(aggregatorContract).isSenderALoan(msg.sender),
            "Only owner or loan"
        );
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        lendInformation.availableAmount += amount;
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
    }
```

In the `DebitaLendOfferFactory` contract set `isLendOrderLegit[msg.sender]` to `false` when the order is deleted

```diff
    function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder {
        uint index = LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder];
        LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder] = 0;

        // switch index of the last borrow order to the deleted borrow order
        allActiveLendOrders[index] = allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1];
        LendOrderIndex[allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]] = index;

        // take out last borrow order

        allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);
+       isLendOrderLegit[msg.sender] = false;

        activeOrdersCount--;
    }
```
