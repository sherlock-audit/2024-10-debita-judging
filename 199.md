# Confidence interval of pyth price is not checked

### Summary

During unusual market conditions, prices can diverge to a significant extent. As a result, pricing is less accurate and there is more risk for losses for users and the not checking of price confidence levels will result in. 

### Root Cause

In `DebitaPyth.sol` the confidence interval of the Pyth price isn't checked when the function `getThePrice` is called [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaPyth.sol#L25). 

This is not following the best practices of the Pyth Oracle as stated in the [pyth documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals). Prices published by publishers can diverge from one another in unique market conditions (e.g. from an exchange preventing exchanging at some point), and during this period of time, the price is far more likely to be inaccurate as the range of potential prices given is significantly larger. 

To mitigate this, these price levels should be checked against a variable such as minimumConfidenceLevel to protect users from potentially inaccurate pricing data. 

This issue was similarly found in a [private audit](https://solodit.cyfrin.io/issues/m-03-confidence-interval-of-pyth-price-is-not-validated-pashov-audit-group-none-reyanetwork-august-markdown)

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Oracle needs to be in a state where the intervals published by publishers is disjoint from each other's published intervals. 

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Inaccurate pricing data could lead to losses for users or the protocol. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check the confidence level against a variable to ensure a minimum level of confidence is met.
