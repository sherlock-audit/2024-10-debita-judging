# Accumulated dust collateral is permanently locked in the `DebitaV3Loan.sol` contract and cannot be withdrawn.

### Summary

The collaterals are transfered to the `DebitaV3Loan.sol` contract if a loan is created. Borrowers can claim their collaterals from `DebitaV3Loan.sol` if they paid their debt, and lenders can claim the collaterals from `DebitaV3Loan.sol` in case of default. When borrows or lenders claim collaterals, the calculated amount to be claimed is rounded down. This leads to dust collateral remaining in the contract and continuously accumulating as the number of transactions increases. However, the loan contract does not provide a withdraw token function to withdraw these collaterals, meaning they will be permanently locked within the contract and unable to be withdrawn. As transaction volumes rise, the quantity of locked collateral could become quite substantial.
