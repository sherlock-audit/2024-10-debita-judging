# Anyone can change Aggregator's contract owner

### Summary

DebitaV3Aggregator's [`changeOwner`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682-L686) function argument owner shadows the global storage `owner` property. Due to this shadowing, the ownership check `require(msg.sender == owner)` compares against the function argument instead of storage, allowing any user to bypass authorization and change contract ownership within the 6-hour window.

### Root Cause

In DebitaV3Aggregator.sol, the `changeOwner` function has a local parameter named owner that shadows the contract's storage variable:
```solidity
address public owner;  // storage variable

function changeOwner(address owner) public {  // parameter shadows storage
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");  // compares with parameter, not storage!
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = owner;  // storage is correctly updated with parameter
}
```

Because of shadowing, the `require(msg.sender == owner)` check compares `msg.sender` with the function parameter instead of the storage variable. Any caller can pass their own address as the parameter to satisfy this check. The final assignment correctly updates the storage variable, making the attack successful.

### Internal pre-conditions

Contract must be within 6 hours of deployment

### External pre-conditions

1. Attacker must call the function just before deployedTime + 6 hours
2. Attacker must pass their own address as the owner parameter

### Attack Path

1. Attacker waits for contract deployment
2. Just before  6 hours elapse, attacker calls `changeOwner(attackerAddress)`
3. `require(msg.sender == owner)` passes because it compares `msg.sender` with the parameter owner (both being attacker's address)
4. `owner = owner` succesfully assigns attacker's address to storage
5. Attacker successfully becomes the new owner

### Impact

1. Critical severity due to complete privilege escalation
2. Any user can bypass ownership check and become owner
3. Attacker gains permanent control of admin functions
4. Time window limitation (6 hours) reduces but doesn't eliminate the risk

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the ownership check by avoiding parameter shadowing:

```solidity
function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");  // compares with storage
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = newOwner;  // updates storage with parameter
}
```
