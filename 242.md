# Connectors can't receive `feeToConnector` during loan extensions

### Summary

During the creation of a `DebitaV3Loan`, connectors receive a portion of the fees (`feeToConnector`) as compensation for facilitating the match between lenders and borrowers. However, in the `extendLoan` function, no mechanism exists to calculate or transfer a fee to the connector. This oversight results in connectors not being compensated for loan extensions, reducing their incentives to participate and potentially impacting the platform's efficiency.


### Root Cause

The `extendLoan` function does not include logic to calculate or transfer the `feeToConnector`, which is only implemented during the initial loan creation. This omission prevents connectors from being compensated for loan extensions. Additionally, the connector's address is not stored for use during extensions, making it impossible to route fees appropriately.

**Connector must receive `feeCONNECTOR` of `feeAmount`**

### Attack Path

1. **Loan Creation:**
   - A connector facilitates a loan match between lenders and borrowers, earning `feeToConnector` during the loan creation.

2. **Loan Extension:**
   - The borrower calls the `extendLoan()` function to extend the loan duration.
   - The `extendLoan` function calculates and transfers fees (`feePerDay`) but does not include any mechanism to calculate or transfer `feeToConnector`.

3. **Connector Compensation Missed:**
   - The connector who initially facilitated the loan receives no compensation for the extended duration, even though their efforts led to the loan’s creation.

4. **Impact:**
   - Connectors lose their incentive to facilitate matches, reducing platform activity and user engagement over time.

### Impact

Connectors are not compensated during loan extensions, reducing their incentives to participate and potentially decreasing platform efficiency and user engagement.

### Mitigation

1. **Introduce Connector Fee in `extendLoan`:**  
   Add logic to calculate and transfer `feeToConnector` during loan extensions based on the extended duration and principal amounts.

2. **Store Connector Address:**  
   Store the connector’s address during loan creation to ensure it is available for fee distribution in future extensions.

3. **Update `extendLoan` Logic:**  
   Include the following in `extendLoan`:
   ```solidity
   uint feeAmount = (principleAmount * misingBorrowFee) / 10000;
   uint extendedFeeToConnector = (feeAmount * feeCONNECTOR) / 10000;

   // Transfer connector fee
   SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(loanData.principles[i]), connectorAddress, extendedFeeToConnector);

   // Transfer remaining fee
   SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(loanData.principles[i]), feeAddress, interestToPayToDebita + feeAmount - extendedFeeToConnector);
   ```
