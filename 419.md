# When a buyOrder is completed the NFT will be locked in the contract forever

### Summary

The ``buyOrder.sol`` contract allows users to provide amount of a certain collateral and create a buy order, and in exchange allow other users to fill said buy order by providing a veNFT that has been locked in the ``Receipt-veNFT.sol`` contract. Once the buy order is created users which hold such receipts for veNFTs can call the [sellNFT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92-L141) function:
```solidity
    function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
        require(buyInformation.isActive, "Buy order is not active");
        require(
            buyInformation.availableAmount > 0,
            "Buy order is not available"
        );

@->     IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            receiptID
        );
        veNFR receipt = veNFR(buyInformation.wantedToken);
        veNFR.receiptInstance memory receiptData = receipt.getDataByReceipt(
            receiptID
        );
        uint collateralAmount = receiptData.lockedAmount;
        uint collateralDecimals = receiptData.decimals;

        uint amount = (buyInformation.buyRatio * collateralAmount) /
            (10 ** collateralDecimals);
        require(
            amount <= buyInformation.availableAmount,
            "Amount exceeds available amount"
        );

        buyInformation.availableAmount -= amount;
        buyInformation.capturedAmount += collateralAmount;
        uint feeAmount = (amount *
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).sellFee()) / 10000;
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(buyInformation.buyToken),
            msg.sender,
            amount - feeAmount
        );

        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(buyInformation.buyToken),
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).feeAddress(),
            feeAmount
        );

        if (buyInformation.availableAmount == 0) {
            buyInformation.isActive = false;
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).emitDelete(address(this));
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory)._deleteBuyOrder(address(this));
        } else {
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).emitUpdate(address(this));
        }
    }
```
However as can be seen from the above code snippet the NFT will be transferred to an instance of the  ``buyOrder.sol`` contract, not the owner of the buyOrder itself. There are no functions in the ``buyOrder.sol`` contract, that allows the owner to transfer that NFT to a different account. This results in the NFT being locked forever in the contract. Keep in mind that veNFTs also have a manager, which can call certain functions, however the manager is not changed when the transfer happens, and the manager can only be changed by the current manager or the owner of the receipt NFT(which in this case will be the buyOrder contract), by calling the [veNFTAerodrome::changeManager()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/veNFTAerodrome.sol#L110-L123) function. 

### Root Cause

In the [sellNFT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92-L141) function, the NFT is transferred to the buyOrder contract, and there is no functionality that allows the owner of the buyOrder to transfer the NFT to a different address. 

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The transferred NFT will be locked in the buyOrder contract forever, and the owner of the said buyOrder would have paid a certain amount of collateral for that token to the user calling the [sellNFT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92-L141) function and providing the NFT. The owner of the buyOrder can't interact with the NFT in any way. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider transfering the NFT directly to the owner of the buyOrder
