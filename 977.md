# Mismatch of limits for lend order in `Aggregator` and `Loan`

### Summary

The `matchOffersV3` function allows a [maximum of 100](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L290) lend orders to be used to close a single borrow order. 
```solidity
require(lendOrders.length <= 100, "Too many lend orders");
```
However, when a `Loan` contract is created in the same function and `Loan::initialize` is called, where the offers array - essentially the same as the lendOrders array - is passed, the initialise function already limits its length to [only 30](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L156).
```solidity
 require(_acceptedOffers.length < 30, "Too many offers");
```

As I said above, acceptedOffers is an array that is formed from the elements of lendOrders and has the same length. So it is not normal when the limits in entrypoint are larger than the limits in the function that will be called afterwards.

Thus, anyone who calls the matchOffersV3 function and inserts more than 30 lendOrders, thinking that the limit is 100, will not be able to execute the function.

### Root Cause

Mismatch of limits for the same arrays 

### Internal pre-conditions

Someone is calling the matchOffersV3 function using a limit of 100, not 30

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This is an obvious error in the protocol code. I don't know what the intended limit on the number of orders is, but when the limit in entrypoint is greater than the limit in the derived call - it creates confusion for those who will call matchOffersV3. 

If it were the other way round and the limit in the entrypoint was less than the limit in the derivative call and no transaction fell - that would be acceptable, but in this formation I'm thinking medium severity
