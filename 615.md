# Using TransferFrom() instead of safeTransferFrom() can cause a loss of funds

### Summary

The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L269
The `claimIncentives()` and `incentivizePair()` functions use ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom().
Some tokens (like USDT) have their transfer/ transferFrom function return void instead of a success boolean. Calling these functions with the correct EIP20 function signatures may fail without reverting.


### Impact

Possibility that the transfer of funds fails and does not return an error, so the function continues as if the transfer was successful.
This results in a loss of funds for the user when he tries to claim his incentives, and also a loss of incentives for the various Pair when the user tries to add them.


### Mitigation

Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the `safeTransfer()` and `safeTransferFrom()` functions that handle the return value check.
