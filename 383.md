# Auction seller able to edit price that is not below floor price causing unfair auction

### Summary

Seller of veTokens deploys the auction contract setting a floor price and can specify the duration of auction causing the price decrease over time. Seller can also edit the floor price but there is a logic error in `editFloorPrice`.

### Root Cause

The issue lies in how `discountedTime` is calculated using `m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock`, which represents the discount rate per second. This value is initialized in the constructor as `tickPerBlock: (curedInitAmount - curedFloorAmount) / _duration`. The purpose of the `if` statement is to check, at the time of modifying the floor price, whether the floor price has already been reached. If so, it adjusts the `initialBlock` to account for when the discount should start, ensuring that the price remains unaffected by the floor price change at that moment. This guarantees that modifying the floor price does not alter the current price, but instead of multiplying the `m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock`, division was used for calculation.

```solidity
        uint newDuration = (m_currentAuction.initAmount - curedNewFloorAmount) /
            m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock;
        // @audit
        uint discountedTime = (m_currentAuction.initAmount -
            m_currentAuction.floorAmount) / m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock;

        if (
            (m_currentAuction.initialBlock + discountedTime) < block.timestamp
        ) {
            // ticket = tokens por bloque   tokens / tokens por bloque = bloques
            m_currentAuction.initialBlock = block.timestamp - (discountedTime);
        }
```

This results in `getCurrentPrice` returning a higher price before it reaches the floor amount. The issue arises because the calculation of `timePassed` yields a smaller value since ` m_currentAuction.initialBlock` returns lower hence also leading to a lower `decreasedAmount`â€”the range by which the initial price decreases over time toward the floor price. Consequently, the computed price, `m_currentAuction.initAmount - decreasedAmount`, will be higher, causing the `buyNFT` function to charge a higher price than intended.

```solidity
        uint timePassed = block.timestamp - m_currentAuction.initialBlock;

        // Calculate the decrease in price based on the time passed and tickPerBlock
        uint decreasedAmount = m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock * timePassed;
        uint currentPrice = (decreasedAmount >
            (m_currentAuction.initAmount - floorPrice))
            ? floorPrice
            : m_currentAuction.initAmount - decreasedAmount; //@audit price gets called here and is higher
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Auction price is above floor price but below the `discountedTime`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Wrong calculated price return to buyer, causing buyer to buy collateral at inflated prices before auction reaches floor amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
    function editFloorPrice(
        uint newFloorAmount
    ) public onlyActiveAuction onlyOwner {
        uint curedNewFloorAmount = newFloorAmount *
            (10 ** s_CurrentAuction.differenceDecimals);
        require(
            s_CurrentAuction.floorAmount > curedNewFloorAmount,
            "New floor lower"
        );

        dutchAuction_INFO memory m_currentAuction = s_CurrentAuction;
        uint newDuration = (m_currentAuction.initAmount - curedNewFloorAmount) /
            m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock;

--        uint discountedTime = (m_currentAuction.initAmount -
--            m_currentAuction.floorAmount) / m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock;

++        uint discountedTime = (m_currentAuction.initAmount -
++            m_currentAuction.floorAmount) * m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock;

        if (
            (m_currentAuction.initialBlock + discountedTime) < block.timestamp
        ) {
            // ticket = tokens por bloque   tokens / tokens por bloque = bloques
            m_currentAuction.initialBlock = block.timestamp - (discountedTime);
        }

        m_currentAuction.duration = newDuration;
        m_currentAuction.endBlock = m_currentAuction.initialBlock + newDuration;
        m_currentAuction.floorAmount = curedNewFloorAmount;
        s_CurrentAuction = m_currentAuction;

        auctionFactory(factory).emitAuctionEdited(
