# No check for edge cases where tickPerBLock is zero in VeNFT Auction

### Summary

In some edge cases [tickPerBlock may be 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L93) due to rounding down.
```solidity
uint curedInitAmount = _initAmount * (10 ** difference);
 uint curedFloorAmount = _floorAmount * (10 ** difference);

        s_CurrentAuction = dutchAuction_INFO({
            auctionAddress: address(this),
            nftAddress: _veNFTAddress,
            nftCollateralID: _veNFTID,
            sellingToken: sellingToken,
            owner: owner,
            initAmount: curedInitAmount,
            floorAmount: curedFloorAmount,
            duration: _duration,
            endBlock: block.timestamp + _duration,
            tickPerBlock: (curedInitAmount - curedFloorAmount) / _duration,
            isActive: true,
            initialBlock: block.timestamp,
            isLiquidation: _isLiquidation,
            differenceDecimals: difference
        });
```
The protocol has no limit on duration. That is, purely theoretically, the user can set it to more than curedInitAmount - curedFloorAmount.

This is unlikely, as curedAmount and curedFloorAmount have a dimension of 18 decimals, but again - the protocol has no limit on the size of the input data. Therefore, the situation is possible. And its occurrence will not be a user error

In this situation tickPerBlock will be 0, which breaks the logic of the contract.

Most importantly, getCurrentPrice will always return initAmount. Most importantly, getCurrentPrice will always return initAmount, which means that the price of NFT will never decrease. 

Moreover, because the editFloorPrice function does not change tickPerBLock parameter - even after floor price change, the price will always be at initAmount level.

```solidity
function getCurrentPrice() public view returns (uint) {
        dutchAuction_INFO memory m_currentAuction = s_CurrentAuction;
        uint floorPrice = m_currentAuction.floorAmount;
        // Calculate the time passed since the auction started/ initial second
        uint timePassed = block.timestamp - m_currentAuction.initialBlock;

        // Calculate the amount decreased with the time passed and the tickPerBlock
        uint decreasedAmount = m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock * timePassed;
        uint currentPrice = (decreasedAmount >
            (m_currentAuction.initAmount - floorPrice))
            ? floorPrice
            : m_currentAuction.initAmount - decreasedAmount;
        // Calculate the current price in case timePassed is false
        // Check if time has passed
        currentPrice =
            currentPrice /
            (10 ** m_currentAuction.differenceDecimals);
        return currentPrice;
    }
```


### Root Cause

No edge case processing when duration is greater than price difference.
In this case tickPerBlock = 0, although the price should be reduced.

### Internal pre-conditions

The user creates an auction whose duration is greater than the difference between initAmount and floorAmount.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Broken logic of contract. The price in a Dutch auction does not decrease over time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Handle edge cases, or add duration max limit
