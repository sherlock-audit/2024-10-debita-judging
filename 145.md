# Parameter shadowing causes the `changeOwner` function to not work.

### Summary

The owner calls the `changeOwner` function to change the contract owner to a new owner. However, the new owner is named `owner`, which shadows the state variable `owner`, causing the `changeOwner` function to not work.

### Root Cause

Parameter shadowing in `changeOwner` causes the function not to work. There are multiple instances of this issue in the contracts.
```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```

        owner = owner;
    }
