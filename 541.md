### Attack Path

Within the `DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3` function, the price is calculated using USD-nominated pair with 8 decimal precision. If the price returned from the Chainlink oracle is not 8 decimals, the calculation will be incorrect, which lead to the ratio/price to be inflated or deflated.

454:                     lendInfo.maxLTVs[collateralIndex]) / 10000;
455:                 uint principleDecimals = ERC20(principles[principleIndex])
456:                     .decimals();

```

Upon inspecting the `DebitaChainlink.getThePrice` function, it was found that the code always assumes that the price returned from Chainlink Oracle is always 8 decimals. However, this assumption is wrong. There are some USD-nominated pair, such as AMPL/USD, that report prices using 18 decimals. Refer to this [article](https://medium.com/cyfrin/chainlink-oracle-defi-attacks-93b6cb6541bf#87fc)'s "Assuming Oracle Price Precision" section foe more details.

As a result, the calculated price/ratio will be inflated or deflated. When the price/ratio of collateral/principle tokens is incorrect, more or less collateral/principle tokens within the lending/borrow offers will be matched, resulting in a loss for the lender or borrower.

For instance, if the collateral price within the borrow offer is inflated, the protocol will assume that the borrow offer contains collateral that is worth much more than expected and allow them to borrow more principle than expected from the lenders, resulting in a loss for the affected lenders.

### Impact

High. As a result, the calculated price/ratio will be inflated or deflated. When the price/ratio of collateral/principle tokens is incorrect, more or less collateral/principle tokens within the lending/borrow offers will be matched, resulting in a loss for the lender or borrower.

For instance, if the collateral price within the borrow offer is inflated, the protocol will assume that the borrow offer contains collateral that is worth much more than expected and allow them to borrow more principle than expected from the lenders, resulting in a loss for the affected lenders.
