# The protocol assumes that every ERC20 has .decimals() function.

### Summary

Debita Finance uses `.decimals()` that ensures the calculation properly considers the token's precision. Without this, the computations might misrepresent the actual token values. However there are ERC20 that lacks this function and they are 100% ERC20 compatible.

### Root Cause

In [`DebitaV3Aggregator`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L167) There are three places where `.decimals()` is used:


[DebitaV3Aggregator::L348](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L348):

```solidity
uint principleDecimals = ERC20(principles[i]).decimals();
```

[DebitaV3Aggregator::L371](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L371):

```solidity
uint decimalsCollateral = ERC20(borrowInfo.valuableAsset).decimals();
```

[DebitaV3Aggreagor::L453](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L455-L456):

```solidity
uint principleDecimals = ERC20(principles[principleIndex]).decimals();
```

### Impact

The Borrow offers or Lend offers that uses ERC20 without `.decimals()` function will not be able to be matched by anyone since the aggregator contracts expects both of them to implement it.
 

The protocol's answer for the question about weird tokens from sherlock sayst that:

> any ERC20 that follows exactly the standard (eg. 18/6 decimals)

However, *exactly the standard* does not means that `decimals()` is included. According to the [Official EIP20 Documentation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#decimals) this function is `OPTIONAL`

### Mitigation

Recommend using a tryCatch block to query the decimals. If it fails, hardcode it to 18 for scaling.
