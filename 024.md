# Implementation Contract Initialization Vulnerability (Root Cause: Lack of Zero Address Validation + Impact: Irreversible Configuration)


### Summary


In the constructor of `DBOFactory`, the address of the `implementationContract` is set without validating whether it is
a valid non-zero address. This design flaw means that if an invalid or zero address is accidentally assigned, the
contract has no mechanism to update or replace this value. This is problematic as the contract lacks a failsafe for
critical misconfigurations, leading to potential contract malfunctions or the inability to deploy new borrow orders
through `implementationContract`.


### Root Cause

Without a validation mechanism, the contract lacks a failsafe for correcting such errors, which can lead to irreversible issues if an incorrect address is assigned.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Address would always be what was set and if address(0) then it cant changed 
### Impact

Having unused variables, especially ones set in the constructor, can cause confusion for future developers or auditors, who might assume it has functionality within the contract. Additionally, this variable could increase gas costs if stored without purpose

### PoC

The constructor does not validate the `_implementationContract` parameter. Hereâ€™s the relevant snippet:

```solidity
constructor(address _implementationContract) {
owner = msg.sender;
implementationContract = _implementationContract; // No check for address(0)
}
```

If `_implementationContract` is passed as `address(0)`, there is no way to reset or correct this, and all attempts to
create borrow orders will fail or behave unpredictably.




### Mitigation

In the constructor, validate that the `_implementationContract` is a non-zero address:

```solidity
constructor(address _implementationContract) {
require(_implementationContract != address(0), "Invalid implementation address");
owner = msg.sender;
implementationContract = _implementationContract;
}
```
This check will prevent the contract from being misconfigured with an invalid `implementationContract`, ensuring future
borrow orders can be created correctly.
