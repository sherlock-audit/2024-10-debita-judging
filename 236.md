# Incorrect calculation of extended loan days leads to unfair borrower fees

### Summary

The miscalculation of extended loan days in the `extendLoan` function will cause borrowers to face unfair fees as the function incorrectly calculates the fee based on `offer.maxDeadline` instead of using the actual extended days derived from `nextDeadline()` and `m_loan.startedAt`. This leads to inflated fee deductions during loan extensions.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan.sol:602`, the calculation of the extended days incorrectly uses `offer.maxDeadline` as the basis for the fee calculation instead of the actual extended period derived from `nextDeadline()` and `m_loan.startedAt`. This results in an inflated `feeOfMaxDeadline`, leading to excessive fees for borrowers.

**Real extended `maxDeadline` is `nextDeadline()`, not `offer.maxDeadline`.**

`// calculate difference from fee paid for the initialDuration vs the extra fee they should pay because of the extras days of extending the loan.  MAXFEE shouldnt be higher than extra fee + PorcentageOfFeePaid`

### Attack Path

1. The borrower calls the `extendLoan()` function to extend their loan duration.  
2. The function validates initial conditions:
   - `loanData.extended` is `false`.  
   - `nextDeadline()` returns a timestamp greater than `block.timestamp`.  
   - `offer.maxDeadline` is a valid future timestamp.  
3. The function calculates `feeOfMaxDeadline` as:
   ```solidity
   uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) / 86400);
   ```
   This incorrectly uses `offer.maxDeadline` instead of the actual extended period derived from `nextDeadline()` and `m_loan.startedAt`.  
4. The miscalculation leads to an inflated `feeOfMaxDeadline` and `misingBorrowFee`.  
5. The inflated fees are deducted from the borrower's principal during the loan extension.  
6. The borrower loses more principal than necessary due to the incorrect fee calculation.  

### Impact

Borrowers will be charged inflated fees due to the incorrect calculation of the extended loan days. This results in unnecessary principal loss, making loan extensions disproportionately costly. Over time, this could discourage borrowers from using the loan extension feature, cause financial hardship, and lead to reputational damage for the platform as users perceive the fee structure as unfair or exploitative.

### Mitigation

```solidity
uint extendedDays = nextDeadline() - m_loan.startedAt;
require(extendedDays > 0, "Invalid extended days");

uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((extendedDays * feePerDay) / 86400);
```
