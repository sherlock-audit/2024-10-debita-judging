# Potential for auctions to execute at bad prices for the seller

### Summary

The issue comes down to the fact that the price in the dutch auction will be continually decreasing even if there is current sequencer downtime. The price will decrease despite there being no chance for the prospective buyers to purchase the nft through the [buyNFT function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L109-L161) So, the seller may not get as high a price as they would have been able to gain otherwise. 

### Root Cause

The issue derives from the tendency for l2s like arbitrum (which this protocol will be deployed to), to experience periods of downtime. During this time, no transactions will be able to take place, however, the price of the dutch auction, will still continue to fall (`uint decreasedAmount = m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock * timePassed;`) as time passes, therefore, the prices the seller receives from the auction, have a decent chance of not being the maximum amount they could achieve, so there are losses for the seller.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Arbitrum sequencer undergoes downtime during the time period when a dutch auction is taking place. 

### Attack Path

An NFT is put up for auction (initial price 100 USDC, floor price 10 USDC)
User A is planning on purchasing at a price of 50 USDC
During the time period as the price is dropping from $100 - $20 the sequencer undergoes downtime
User A waits for their opportunity to buy and can purchase the NFT at a discount of what they were planning on buying, leading to losses for the seller. 



### Impact
Financial loss for the seller, as the value of the asset may be sold well below the actual market price

### Mitigation

Check sequencer uptime and redo the auction if the sequencer experienced downtime at any point during the auction.
