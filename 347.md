# M-1: Due to the incorrect implementation of the `changeOwner` function, the owner cannot be successfully changed.

### Summary

The contract's owner can only be changed within 0 to 6 hours after deployment, but in reality, the owner cannot be successfully changed. This is because the `changeOwner` function is incorrectly implemented, preventing the owner from being successfully changed.

### Root Cause

The incorrect implementation of the `changeOwner` function prevents the owner from being successfully changed.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The current owner, for certain reasons, wants to change to a new owner within 6 hours. However, due to the incorrect implementation of the `changeOwner` function, the owner cannot actually be changed, so the owner will remain as the current owner's address.

The following three `changeOwner` functions all have implementation errors.

1. [DebitaV3Aggregator::changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682-L686)
2. [AuctionFactory::changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218-L222)
3. [buyOrderFactory::changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186-L190)

### Impact

Due to the incorrect implementation of the `changeOwner` function, the owner cannot be successfully changed, which undermines the intended behavior of this feature.

Personal opinion:
1. The contest details do not specify that the owner is restricted or trusted.
2. The requirement to change the owner within a limited time, such as within 6 hours, highlights the importance of this function!
3. Although no financial loss has occurred, since `changeOwner` is a core function, I believe it meets the criteria for Medium severity according to Sherlock's evaluation, as a core function is affected.

### PoC

A simple POC demonstrating its impact: executing the `changeOwner` function in Remix.

When the current owner attempts to change the address `0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2` to a new owner, it is found that the owner is not successfully changed. The current owner remains `0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4`.

contract TestChange {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    function changeOwner(address owner) public returns (address){
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        return owner = owner;
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

The following three functions can all be fixed in this way.

1. `DebitaV3Aggregator::changeOwner`
2. `AuctionFactory::changeOwner`
3. `buyOrderFactory::changeOwner`

```diff
-    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
+    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
-        owner = owner;
+        owner = newOwner;
    }
```
