# Index conflict in _deleteAuctionOrder: Deleting Auction Order Ambiguity

### Summary

The [`_deleteAuctionOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L145) and every delete functions of `Factory` Contracts are designed to remove an active implementation, identified by its address, from the `allActiveOrders` array and update the corresponding index mappings. The function is intended to keep track of active orders by re-indexing them in a way that maintains order integrity while reducing the `activeOrdersCount`.

### Root Cause

Here is an example of `AuctionFactory` Contract which uses the same logic for evey factory contract of protocol

The first creator of auction will get the 0th index of the `AuctionOrderIndex` mapping:

```solidity
    function createAuction(
        uint _veNFTID,
        address _veNFTAddress,
        address liquidationToken,
        uint _initAmount,
        uint _floorAmount,
        uint _duration
    ) public returns (address) {
       ...
        // LOGIC INDEX
        AuctionOrderIndex[address(_createdAuction)] = activeOrdersCount;
       ...
    }
```

`activeOrdersCount` initially is set to 0 at declaration. Then at the `_deleteAuctionOrder` function sets the auction address to 0th index assuming that 0 is not used as valid index.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. This conflict can lead to incorrect behavior when other functions try to retrieve the index of auction orders, as they may mistakenly interpret a `0` index as either an active order at index `0` or a deleted order. This can lead to data inconsistencies.

2. Other functions that rely on AuctionOrderIndex to access or manage active orders may misinterpret a deleted order as an active one, causing unwanted errors or undefined behavior in the contract.

### PoC

```solidity
    function testCreateAuction() public {
        vm.startPrank(seller);

        veNFTContract.approve(address(factory), 1);
        auction = factory.createAuction(1, address(veNFTContract), address(AERO), 100, 50, 100);

        vm.stopPrank();
        uint index = factory.AuctionOrderIndex(auction);

        console.log("index of first auction %s", index);
        assertTrue(factory.isAuction(auction));

        address secondSeller = makeAddr("secondSeller");
        veNFTContract.mint(secondSeller, 2);
        vm.startPrank(secondSeller);

        veNFTContract.approve(address(factory), 2);
        address secondAuction = factory.createAuction(2, address(veNFTContract), address(AERO), 100, 50, 100);

        vm.stopPrank();
        
        uint index2 = factory.AuctionOrderIndex(secondAuction);
        console.log("index of second auction %s", index2);
        vm.prank(secondSeller);
        DutchAuction_veNFT(secondAuction).cancelAuction();
        
        index2 = factory.AuctionOrderIndex(secondAuction);
        console.log("index of second auction after cancel %s", index2);
    }
```

```plain
Logs:
  index of first auction 0
  index of second auction 1
  index of second auction after cancel 0
```

### Mitigation

Increment `activeOrdersCount` at the start of `createAuction` function to skip the 0 and reserve it for non-exisiting auctions.
