# If the Lender doesn't set a Oracle, Borrower could set any malicious contract as Oracle,

### Summary

In DebitaAggregatorV3::matchOfferV3, when a Borrow Order and a Lender Order are matching, if the Lender Order doesn't include a oracle and just set a fixed ratio, the Borrower on the other end can specify any Oracle he wants, disturbing the price of the Collateral to be higher that it actually is and the Principal price to be lower than it actually is also.  

### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Aggregator.sol::309](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L309C13-L309C56)  Borrower can set any collateral price.

In [DebitaV3Aggregator.sol::334](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L334C15-L334C52) Borrower can set any Principal Price.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Lender should create an Lend Offer without a Oracle set for either the collateral or the principle or both 
2. Borrower should create a Borrow Offer with a Malicious contract address that include the `getPriceFrom` function
3. The Aggregator will match the Borrow Offer to the Lender offer, as the Lender offert has not any Oracle set, the price are only fetch from the Borrower Oracle address. 
4. The malicious Borrower's Oracle contract could artificially increase the Collateral Price and/or decrease the Principle Price, so the Borrower could withdraw way more , in term of value, that the Collateral let him borrow 

### Attack Path

1. The Borrower has to deploy a Malicious Oracle that include the `getPriceFrom` function so the `DebitaV3Aggregator` can call it. 

### Impact

The Lender will get some Collateral that was artificially value inflated where most of his Principle Lend will never be seing back again as the Borrower will never repay the debt.
