# Any update/cancel function in DBO and DLO can be frontrunned

### Summary

Let's look at the functions
- [`DBO::cancelOffer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L188).
- [`DBO::updateBorrowOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L232).
- [`DLO::updateLendOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L195).
- [`DLO::changePerpetual`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L178).
- [`DLO::cancelOffer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L144)

Each of these functions modifies the borrowOffer, lendOrder parameters. 
However, a call to each of these functions can be frontrun by any user by calling `matchOffersV3` which will use the old function parameters.

Given that one of the networks on which the contract will be deployed is Fantom, which is an L1 blockchain, the problem of fronrunning should be taken seriously.


### Root Cause

Changing important borrowORder, lendOrder parameters should be done in two stages to protect the call of these functions from frontrunning

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Borrower wants to change maxApr for borrowOffer
2. Anyone frontrun this transaction and match borrowOffer with old maxApr

### Impact

The lack of any protection against frontrunning, especially on L1 networks, allows attackers to execute transactions at amounts more favourable to them, thereby disrupting the honest work of both borrowers and lenders

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a two-stage mechanism. The first call users pause the entire contract. The second call changes the parameters and then unpause the contract.
