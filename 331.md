# Permanent Loss of Lender NFT Due to Improper Claim Flow

### Summary

When a lender attempts to claim NFT collateral, their lender NFT can be burned without receiving any assets in return if specific conditions aren't met. This results in a permanent loss of claim rights and potential value locked in the protocol.


### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from an improper flow control in the claimCollateralAsLender function. If calleteral is NFT `claimCollateralAsLender` calls  `claimCollateralAsNFTLender`  function.
The `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` function does not revert if neither of its conditions (auctionInitialized or a single accepted offer) is satisfied. Instead, it simply returns false, leaving the lender without their claim.

```solidity
function claimCollateralAsLender(uint lenderID) public nonReentrant returns (bool) {
    // Burns NFT immediately without checking if claim will succeed
    ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID);

    // Checks conditions after burning
    if (m_loan.auctionInitialized) {
        // auction claim logic
    } else if (m_loan._acceptedOffers.length == 1 && !m_loan.auctionInitialized) {
        // single lender claim logic
    }
    return false; // Returns false if conditions not met, but NFT is already burned
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The collateral must be an NFT
2. The loan must have multiple lenders (_acceptedOffers.length > 1)
3. The auction must not be initialized
4. A lender must attempt to claim their collateral portion

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Lenders lose their NFT ownership without receiving the collateral and  lenderâ€™s claim for the collateral becomes irrecoverable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
function claimCollateralAsLender(uint lenderID) public nonReentrant returns (bool) {
    // Check conditions first
    require(
        m_loan.auctionInitialized || 
        (m_loan._acceptedOffers.length == 1 && !m_loan.auctionInitialized),
        "Invalid claim conditions"
    );
```
