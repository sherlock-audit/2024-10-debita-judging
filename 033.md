# Buying receipts does not change the veNFT manager, allowing manager to perform unwanted operation

### Summary

User that sells receipts to get quick liquidity did not change the manager of the receipts, allowing the seller which assuming has the manager address to perform unauthorized operation.

### Root Cause

There is a missing function `veNFTAerodrome::changeManager` not called [LoC](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/veNFTAerodrome.sol#L110) to change the manager to the new owner. Hence, the previous manager can perform the actions such as `voteMultiple`, `claimBribesMultiple`, `resetMultiple`, `extendMultiple` & `pokeMultiple` in `Receipt-veNFT.sol`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1) User A create buyOrder
2) User B sells his receipt to User A
3) User B still has the ability to vote for his pool, extend the voting escrow and steal bribes.

- Side Note: If User B calls changeManager, User A can frontrun that transaction and perform (3)
### Impact

The buyer may the privilege of voting and resetting during that epoch, also have bribes stolen.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include function `changeManager` and set it to buyer.
