# Incorrect Handling of Token Decimals Leads to Miscalculation of Collateral Value

@0xRaz-b
Severity : High
Likelihood : High

#### **Summary**

Incorrect handling of token decimals in price calculations will cause under-collateralization risk for **lenders**, as **borrowers** will provide insufficient collateral due to miscalculated collateral value when token decimals differ between collateral and principal tokens.

---

#### **Root Cause**

In `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol`, within the `matchOffersV3` function, the calculation of `ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral` does not account for differences in token decimals between the collateral and principal tokens:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L350-L351


This calculation assumes that `priceCollateral_BorrowOrder` and `pricePrinciple` have the same decimal precision, leading to miscalculations when they differ.

---

#### **Internal Pre-conditions**

1. **Borrower** uses a collateral token with a certain number of decimals (e.g., 8 decimals).
2. **Lender** provides a principal token with a different number of decimals (e.g., 18 decimals).
3. `priceCollateral_BorrowOrder` and `pricePrinciple` return prices without consistent decimal scaling.

---

#### **External Pre-conditions**

- The oracle provides prices without adjusting for token decimals.

---

#### **Attack Path**

1. **Borrower** creates a borrow order using a collateral token with fewer decimals than the principal token.
2. **Lender** matches the borrow order through `matchOffersV3`.
3. The `matchOffersV3` function miscalculates `ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral` due to incorrect decimal handling.
4. **Borrower** provides less collateral than required based on the miscalculated ratio.
5. **Lender** accepts the under-collateralized loan unknowingly.

---

#### **Impact**

- **Under-Collateralization Risk:** If the collateral's price has fewer decimals than the principal's price, the calculated collateral value will be underestimated. This means lenders might accept insufficient collateral, exposing them to potential losses if borrowers default.

- **Over-Collateralization:** Conversely, if the collateral's price has more decimals, borrowers may be required to provide more collateral than necessary, leading to inefficient capital usage.

- **Financial Inconsistencies:** Miscalculations can lead to incorrect loan terms, affecting interest rates, LTV ratios, and overall platform integrity.

---

#### **Mitigation**

Modify the `matchOffersV3` function to properly account for token decimals:

1. **Retrieve Token Decimals:**
   - Obtain decimals for both collateral and principal tokens using `ERC20(token).decimals()`.

2. **Adjust Calculations:**
   - Modify the calculation to include decimal adjustments:

     ```solidity
     uint collateralDecimals = ERC20(borrowInfo.valuableAsset).decimals();
     uint principleDecimals = ERC20(principles[i]).decimals();
     uint ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = (priceCollateral_BorrowOrder * 10 ** (principleDecimals)) / (pricePrinciple * 10 ** (collateralDecimals));
     ```
