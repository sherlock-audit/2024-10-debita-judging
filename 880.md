# getThePrice function to fetch price of asset can return outdated values because of missing checks

### Summary

`getThePrice` function in DebitaChainlink.sol does not check for timestamp of the pricefeed's latest round data to make sure that its not [outdated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L42).


### Root Cause
