# Valid lenders and borrowers may not receive their incentives due to sequence of `lenders`

## **Summary**
The `updateFunds` function in the `DebitaIncentives` contract processes a list of offers and updates the funds for lenders and borrowers. However, it checks the `isPairWhitelisted` condition sequentially for each offer. If one pair is not whitelisted, the function exits without processing the remaining offers. So the valid lenders couldn't get incentives and more seriously this allows malicious matchers to control which valid lenders and borrowers receive incentives by altering the order of `lendOrders` passed to the `matchOffersV3` function in the `DebitaV3Aggregator` contract.

## **Attack Path**
1. **Whitelisting constraint xxploitation:**
   - A matcher (the entity calling `matchOffersV3`) crafts a `lendOrders` array containing both valid and invalid pairs for whitelisting in the `DebitaIncentives` contract.

2. **Submission of malicious order:**
   - The matcher places a valid pair after an invalid pair in the `lendOrders` array.

3. **Function execution:**
   - When `matchOffersV3` is called, the `updateFunds` function processes the `lendOrders` sequentially.
   - Upon encountering the first invalid pair, `updateFunds` exits, leaving the subsequent valid pairs unprocessed.

4. **Result:**
   - Incentives are denied to valid lenders and borrowers for the unprocessed pairs.

## **Impact**
- **Incentive mismanagement:** 
  Valid lenders and borrowers may not receive their due incentives if they are positioned after an invalid pair in the `lendOrders` array.
  
- **Economic xxploitation:**
  The matcher has undue control over the distribution of incentives, potentially favoring certain lenders or borrowers while excluding others.
  
- **Trust erosion:**
  Users may lose confidence in the fairness of the system, reducing participation and adoption.

## **Mitigation**
1. **Logic Update in `updateFunds`:**
   - Modify the loop to continue processing subsequent offers even if an invalid pair is encountered.
   - Example: 
     ```solidity
     for (uint i = 0; i < lenders.length; i++) {
         bool validPair = isPairWhitelisted[informationOffers[i].principle][collateral];
         if (!validPair) {
             // Skip this offer but do not exit the loop
             continue;
         }
         // Proceed with the rest of the logic
     }
     ```
