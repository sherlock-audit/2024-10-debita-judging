# Not able to create a borrow order of a NFT.

### Summary

Because of using the IERC721 interface without importing it from the Openzeppelin, the user won't be able to create a borrow order of an NFT. 

### Root Cause

At `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L126`, an NFT is transferred as collateral by the user to the `DBOImplementation` contract using the `IERC721.transferFrom()` function. However, there is no import of the `IERC721` interface from OpenZeppelin anywhere in the contract. This oversight prevents the contract from creating a borrow order for an NFT, as it lacks the necessary interface to interact with the ERC-721 token standard.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Need to call create a borrow order with the proper parameters including `_isNFT` as `true` and valid `_recieptID` to reproduce the issue.

### Impact

The user cannot create a borrow order of a NFT type.

### PoC

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.0;

import {Test} from "forge-std";
import {DBOFactory} from "@contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol";

contract DebitaBorrowOfferFactoryTest is Test {
    function testMissingIERC721Import() public {
        address implementationContract = address(0x123);
        DBOFactory factory = new DBOFactory(implementationContract);
        bool[] oraclesActived;
        oraclesActived[0] = true;
        uint[] LTVs;
        LTVs[0] = 50;
        address[] acceptedPrinciples;
        acceptedPrinciples[0] = address(0x321);
        address[] oracleIDSPrinciples;
        oracleIDSPrinciples[0] = address(0x432);
        uint ratio;
        ratio[0] = 100;
        uint receiptID = 1;
        uint collateralAmount = 1;
        vm.startPrank(address(1));
        vm.expectRevert("IERC721 is not imported");
        factory.createBorrowOrder(
            oraclesActived,
            LTVs,
            10,
            30 days,
            acceptedPrinciples,
            address(0xabc),
            true,
            receiptID,
            oracleIDSPrinciples,
            ratio,
            address(0xdef),
            collateralAmount
        );
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Add this line to the imports.

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol";
```
