# wrong refund while cancelling loan offer

### Summary


    function cancelOffer() public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        uint availableAmount = lendInformation.availableAmount;
        lendInformation.perpetual = false;
        lendInformation.availableAmount = 0; ////---->@audit resets to 0
        require(availableAmount > 0, "No funds to cancel");----->////@audit
        isActive = false;


        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            availableAmount
        );
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
        // emit canceled event on factory

the Problem is If lendInformation.availableAmount is set to 0 before the require check, it will cause the availableAmount variable to be 0 before the check, and the require(availableAmount > 0) will fail

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

if the available amount is more than 0 the lender will lose his funds

### PoC

reset lendInformation.availableAmount = 0;, this would make availableAmount 0, and the subsequent require(availableAmount > 0) will fail because availableAmount is no longer greater than 0
This would lead to a revert, even if the original lendInformation.availableAmount was non-zero before resetting it.



### Mitigation

To prevent this, the require statement must be placed before the reset
