# tokens are not transferred to buyer in buyorder.sol

### Summary

The buyer creates a buy order via the createBuyOrder function.
The seller fulfills the buy order using the sellNFT function.
The seller transfers the NFT to the contract.
The contract checks the buy order and ensures the conditions are met.
The NFT is then transferred to the buyer, and tokens are transferred to the seller.

however the function does not transfer the wanted tokens to the buyer it only transfers the tokens to the seller
The function transfers the NFT from the seller's address to the contract's address (address(this)

    function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
        require(buyInformation.isActive, "Buy order is not active");
        require(
            buyInformation.availableAmount > 0,
            "Buy order is not available"
        );

        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            receiptID
        );
        veNFR receipt = veNFR(buyInformation.wantedToken);
        veNFR.receiptInstance memory receiptData = receipt.getDataByReceipt(
            receiptID
        );
        uint collateralAmount = receiptData.lockedAmount;
        uint collateralDecimals = receiptData.decimals;

        uint amount = (buyInformation.buyRatio * collateralAmount) /
            (10 ** collateralDecimals);
        require(
            amount <= buyInformation.availableAmount,
            "Amount exceeds available amount"
        );

        buyInformation.availableAmount -= amount;
        buyInformation.capturedAmount += collateralAmount;
        uint feeAmount = (amount *
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).sellFee()) / 10000;
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(buyInformation.buyToken),
            msg.sender,
            amount - feeAmount
        );

        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(buyInformation.buyToken),
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).feeAddress(),
            feeAmount
        );

        if (buyInformation.availableAmount == 0) {
            buyInformation.isActive = false;
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).emitDelete(address(this));
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory)._deleteBuyOrder(address(this));
        } else {
            IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).emitUpdate(address(this));
        }
    }
as you can see the function transfers the buytoken to the seller but it performs no transfer of the nft token to the buyer
when we look at createbuyerorder

      function createBuyOrder(
        address _token,
        address wantedToken,
        uint _amount,
        uint ratio
    ) public returns (address) {
        // CHECKS
        require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(ratio > 0, "Ratio must be greater than 0");


        DebitaProxyContract proxy = new DebitaProxyContract(
            implementationContract
        );
        BuyOrder _createdBuyOrder = BuyOrder(address(proxy));


        // INITIALIZE THE BUY ORDER
        _createdBuyOrder.initialize(
            msg.sender,
            _token,
            wantedToken,
            address(this),
            _amount,
            ratio
        );


        // TRANSFER TOKENS TO THE BUY ORDER
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(_token),
            msg.sender,
            address(_createdBuyOrder),
            _amount
        );

here the function transfers the tokens from the buyorder caller to  address(_createdBuyOrder),

but the buyers buy tokens isnt transferred to the buyer  anywhere while performing the trade

### Root Cause

the function does not transfer the buyer tokens to the buyer

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

loss of funds for the buyer since no tokens are trasnsferred to the buyer and there is also no function that allows the buyer to withdraw the tokens from the contract

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

transfer the buyers share of token
