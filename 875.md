# Previous owner can steal unclaimed bribes from new owner of veNFTVault

### Summary

Previous owner can steal unclaimed bribes from new owner of `veNFT`, because transfering ownership of `veNFT` does not change the manager (which can claim bribes, vote).

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/Receipt-veNFT.sol#L128-L142)
```solidity
function claimBribesMultiple(
        address[] calldata vaults,
        address[] calldata _bribes,
        address[][] calldata _tokens
    ) external {
        for (uint i; i < vaults.length; i++) {
            require(
                msg.sender == veNFTVault(vaults[i]).managerAddress(),
                "not manager"
            );
            require(isVaultValid[vaults[i]], "not vault");
            veNFTVault(vaults[i]).claimBribes(msg.sender, _bribes, _tokens);
            emitInteracted(vaults[i]);
        }
    }
```
Each `veNFTVault.sol` has manager role, which by default is owner of `veNFTVault`:
```solidity
veNFTVault vault = new veNFTVault(
                nftAddress,
                address(this),
                m_Receipt,
                nftsID[i],
                msg.sender
            );
//...
          s_ReceiptID_to_Vault[m_Receipt] = address(vault);
//...
          _mint(msg.sender, m_Receipt);
```
But transfering ownership of `veNFTVault` by transfering `receiptID` does not change the manager - old manager can still call all of this functions: `voteMultiple()`, `claimBribesMultiple()`, `resetMultiple()`, `extendMultiple()` and `pokeMultiple()`. Main impact that old manager cam steal unclaimed bribes from new owner by calling `claimBribesMultiple()`:
```solidity
 function claimBribesMultiple(
        address[] calldata vaults,
        address[] calldata _bribes,
        address[][] calldata _tokens
    ) external {
        for (uint i; i < vaults.length; i++) {
            require(
                msg.sender == veNFTVault(vaults[i]).managerAddress(),
                "not manager"
            );
            require(isVaultValid[vaults[i]], "not vault");
            veNFTVault(vaults[i]).claimBribes(msg.sender, _bribes, _tokens);
            emitInteracted(vaults[i]);
        }
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- Malicious user wants to sell ownership of `veNFTVault`, which has for example 1000 USDC of unclaimed bribes;
- Victim expects to become owner of `veNFTVault` and have the ability to claim unclaimed bribes, vote, and so on;
- Malicious user claims bribes right after transfering `receiptID`, because he is still the manager of the vault;
- Bribes are sent to previous malicious owner, not current holder of `receiptID`:
```solidity
SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
                    ERC20(_tokens[i][j]),
                    sender,
                    amountToSend
                );
```

### Impact

Previous owner can still call all of this functions: `voteMultiple()`, `claimBribesMultiple()`, `resetMultiple()`, `extendMultiple()` and `pokeMultiple()`. Main impact that manager (previous owner) cam steal unclaimed bribes from new owner by calling `claimBribesMultiple()`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Override `transferFrom()` function in that way that it also changes `managerAddress`  to new owner's address.
