# A new auction fee applies to already created auctions

### Summary

The auction feature is open to all and anyone can create the auction with the necessary parameters.  The auction takes the auction fee from the auction buyers and sellers are responsible for setting the initial and floor price according to the math they get (amountPaidByBuyer - auctionFeeAmount). The auction takes time and in case of a change in the auction fee, it gets levied to all existing auctions which could cause some loss for the seller in case of increase. [auctionFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L118)

### Root Cause

In [`Auction.sol:118`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L118) for fee calculation, it reads the fee set by the owner of the factory [`AuctionFactory:changeAuctionFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L198) and gets levied to every ongoing auctions

### Internal pre-conditions

The `AuctionFactory.sol` owner changes the auction fee or increases the auction fee

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Seller sets the floor amount and initial amount by doing the math with the existing auction fee of (floorAmount/currentPrice-fee)
2. Admin increases the fee
3. Seller gets less amount than the anticipated math in 1

### Impact

The seller gets less than they anticipated with a math of (floorAmount or currentPrice - fee)

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Since the `auction.sol` takes a bunch of parameters during its deployment from the factory a `fee` can be taken similarly and calculated making the fee fixed for that auction. Helps sellers to price better too.
