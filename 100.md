# Denial of Service Vulnerability in withdraw() Function Due to Lack of receiptID Parameter in veNFTAerodrome.sol

### Summary

In the `withdraw() function` of the veNFTAerodrome.sol contract, there is a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. The function does not allow for the `receiptID` to be passed as a parameter, relying on an internal variable (receiptID) that could be incorrectly set or uninitialized. As a result, users may be unable to withdraw their NFTs, as the contract fails to correctly associate the withdrawal with the proper receipt. This issue can lead to locked assets (NFTs) in the contract, preventing legitimate users from retrieving them.

### Impact

**Denial of Service (DoS):** Users are unable to withdraw their NFTs if the receiptID is incorrect, uninitialized, or mismatches the expected value, resulting in a service disruption where legitimate users cannot access their assets.
**Locked NFTs:** If the receiptID cannot be validated correctly, NFTs could remain locked in the contract indefinitely, causing a loss of access to the assets.
