# Miner can trick the borrower into accepting his last minute modified lend offer by manipulating block.timestamp.

### Summary

The [onlyAfterTimeOut](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L57) of `DLOImplementation` contract is expected to make sure that the lend offer hasn't been modified in the last minute before a borrower can accept it. A miner has the ability to pick block timestamp in a certain range(`parent timestamp < block.timestamp <= 15 min in the future.`). So after seeing that someone has sent a transaction accepting his lend offer a miner can trick the borrower into accepting his last minute modified lend offer by sending a new transaction to [DLOImplementation.updateLendOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L195) that will benefit him and setting `block.timestamp` in a way that will break `onlyAfterTimeOut` check. 

### Root Cause

The [DLOImplementation.updateLendOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L195) function is as follows. 
```solidity
    function updateLendOrder(
        uint newApr,
        uint newMaxDuration,
        uint newMinDuration,
        uint[] memory newLTVs,
        uint[] memory newRatios
    ) public onlyOwner {
        require(isActive, "Offer is not active");
        LendInfo memory m_lendInformation = lendInformation;
        require(
            newLTVs.length == m_lendInformation.acceptedCollaterals.length &&
                newLTVs.length == m_lendInformation.maxLTVs.length &&
                newRatios.length ==
                m_lendInformation.acceptedCollaterals.length,
            "Invalid lengths"
        );
        lastUpdate = block.timestamp;
        m_lendInformation.apr = newApr;
        m_lendInformation.maxDuration = newMaxDuration;
        m_lendInformation.minDuration = newMinDuration;
        m_lendInformation.maxLTVs = newLTVs;
        m_lendInformation.maxRatio = newRatios;

        // update to storage
        lendInformation = m_lendInformation;
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
    }
```
It keeps the`lastUpdate`check when someone modifies their lend offers. 

The [DLOImplementation.acceptLendingOffer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L109) function is as follows:
```solidity
    // function to accept the lending offer
    // only aggregator can call this function
    function acceptLendingOffer(
        uint amount
    ) public onlyAggregator nonReentrant onlyAfterTimeOut {
        LendInfo memory m_lendInformation = lendInformation;
        uint previousAvailableAmount = m_lendInformation.availableAmount;
        .....
        .....
```
It uses an `onlyAfterTimeOut` modifier to perform a check.

The [onlyAfterTimeOut](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L57) is as follows:
```solidity
    modifier onlyAfterTimeOut() {
        require(
            lastUpdate == 0 || (block.timestamp - lastUpdate) > 1 minutes,
            "Offer has been updated in the last minute"
        );
        _;
    }
```
This modifier is expected to make sure that the lend offer hasn't been modified in the last minute before a borrower can accept it.

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
Someone will have to send a transaction accepting the miner's lend offer by calling [DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274).

### Attack Path

1. Miner created a lend offer.
2. Miner sees someone has sent a transaction in the mempool accepting his lend offer. 
3. Miner send a new transaction to modify the lend offer terms that will benefit him by calling [DLOImplementation.updateLendOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L195). 
4. Miner reorders the transaction list giving his `updateLendOrder` call higher priority. 
5. Miner sets `block.timestamp` to a value that will break `block.timestamp - lastUpdate > 1 minutes` check. 

### Impact
Miner can trick the borrower into accepting his modified lend offer by manipulating `block.timestamp`. 

### PoC
N/A

### Mitigation
Change the `onlyAfterTimeOut` modifier as following:
```solidity
    modifier onlyAfterTimeOut() {
        require(
            lastUpdate == 0 || (block.timestamp - lastUpdate) > 15 minutes,
            "Offer has been updated in the last minute"
        );
        _;
    }
```
