# Stuck Incentives Due to Fee-on-Transfer (FOT) Token Discrepancy

### Summary

There’s a problem in the `DebitaIncentives` smart contract when Fee-on-Transfer (FOT) tokens are used for incentivization.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L225

 Here’s what happens:
- When FOT tokens are added as incentives, the contract records the full amount (e.g., 10,000 tokens). However, due to transfer fees, it only receives a smaller amount (e.g., 9,800 tokens).
- When users start claiming their share, the first few users get the rewards as if the full 10,000 tokens are available.
- As more users claim, the contract eventually runs out of tokens before everyone is paid.
- This causes the transaction for the last few claimants to fail, leaving the remaining tokens stuck in the contract with no way to recover them.

- The attacker secures an unfairly large share of rewards before others.
- The attacker ensures they claim an inflated share of the rewards, leaving insufficient tokens for later claimants.
- Other participants face failed claims and lose their incentives.
- Remaining tokens become permanently inaccessible, harming the protocol’s credibility and user trust.

### Root Cause

When someone adds tokens as incentives through the incentivizePair function, the contract records the full amount provided in the function call, regardless of how many tokens are actually transferred.
Example:
- A user incentivizes 10,000 tokens.
- The FOT token has a 2% transfer fee.
- The contract records 10,000 tokens as available for incentives, but only 9,800 tokens are actually received.

```solidity
IERC20(incentivizeToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
lentIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch[principle][hashVariables(incentivizeToken, epoch)] += amount;
```
Here, the contract records amount as the incentive balance but doesn’t check how many tokens were actually transferred.

Distribution Logic Assumes Full Balance:

- The contract calculates rewards for each user based on the recorded incentive balance (e.g., 10,000 tokens in this case), not the actual available balance (9,800 tokens).
- Early claimants receive rewards as if the full balance exists, which depletes the actual tokens in the contract faster than expected.
Example:


         If there are 10 eligible users, each supposed to receive 1,000 tokens
         The first 8 users successfully claim 8,000 tokens in total.
         Now, only 1,800 tokens remain in the contract.
         When the remaining users (e.g., the last 2 claimants) attempt to claim their share (1,000 tokens each), the contract doesn’t have enough tokens to fulfill the transaction.
         The IERC20(token).transfer call fails because the contract has insufficient tokens, reverting the entire transaction.

Stuck Tokens after all the claims:

	•	After the failed transactions, any remaining tokens (e.g., 800 tokens) are left stuck in the contract because:
	•	The claiming process doesn’t allow partial payouts.
	•	The incentives were calculated based on incorrect balances, leaving no mechanism to reclaim or redistribute the leftover tokens.

This assumes the full recorded balance is available for distribution.
If the actual balance is lower, later transactions will fail.
```solidity
uint amountToClaim = (lentIncentive * porcentageLent) / 10000;
IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amountToClaim);
```

### Attack Path

The attcker can monitor if FOT tokens are used as incentives and if is a borrower/lender he can claim the incentives as quickly as possible and the legitimate users of the protocol will not receive their fair amount of share
Let’s say 10,000 FOT tokens are added as incentives. The FOT fee is 2%, so the contract only receives 9,800 tokens.
However, the contract still thinks 10,000 tokens are available for rewards.

Now Users Claim Their Incentives:
	•	There are 10 eligible users, each supposed to get 1,000 tokens.
	•	The first 8 users claim their share, withdrawing 1,000 tokens each.
	•	After 8 claims:

9,800 - (1,000 * 8) = 800

The Problem for the Last 2 Users:
	•	When the last 2 users try to claim their 1,000 tokens each, the transaction fails because there’s only 800 tokens left.
	•	Those 800 tokens are now stuck in the contract, and there’s no way to get them out.


### Impact

1.	Unfair Distribution:
	•	Early claimants receive a higher share than they should, while late claimants get nothing.
2.	Stuck Tokens:
	•	Tokens left in the contract after failed claims are permanently inaccessible.
3.	Exploitation Risk:
	•	A malicious actor could intentionally use FOT tokens to drain rewards for themselves while leaving nothing for others.

### Mitigation

1.	Record Actual Tokens Received:
	•	When someone adds incentives, calculate how many tokens were actually received:
```solidity
uint balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint balanceAfter = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
uint netReceived = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
```
2.	Handle Partial Claims:
	•	If there aren’t enough tokens to fulfill a user’s full claim, give them as much as the contract can:
```solidity
uint availableBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
uint claimableAmount = (amountToClaim <= availableBalance) ? amountToClaim : availableBalance;
IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, claimableAmount);
```
