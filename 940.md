# DebitaChainlink does not check for min/max prices during flash crashes

### Summary

Chainlink price feeds have in-built minimum & maximum prices they will return; if during a flash crash, bridge compromise, or depegging event, an asset’s value falls below the price feed’s minimum price, the oracle price feed will continue to report the (now incorrect) minimum price.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaChainlink::getThePrice` there is no check if the price returned by the oracle is at the minimum or maximum price boundaries indicating a price crash or depeg event

 As a result

An attacker could:

- buy that asset using a decentralized exchange at the very low price,
- deposit the asset into a Lending / Borrowing platform using Chainlink’s price feeds,
- borrow against that asset at the minimum price Chainlink’s price feed returns, even though the actual price is far lower.
This attack would let the attacker drain value from [Lending / Borrowing platforms](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/). To help mitigate such an attack on-chain, smart contracts could check that minAnswer < receivedAnswer < maxAnswer.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Medium - malicious user can exploit the protocol due to incorrect prices 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement the proper check for each asset. It must revert in the case of bad price.

```solidity
    require(price >= minPrice && price <= maxPrice, "invalid price");
```
