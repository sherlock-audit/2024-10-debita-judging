# Flash Loan Borrows can take most of the incentive.

### Summary

The amount of incentive that a lender and borrower will receive in the current round depends on the amount of [principle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L323) they have pledged and received accordingly.

```solidity
function updateFunds(
        infoOfOffers[] memory informationOffers,
        address collateral,
        address[] memory lenders,
        address borrower
    ) public onlyAggregator {
        for (uint i = 0; i < lenders.length; i++) {
            bool validPair = isPairWhitelisted[informationOffers[i].principle][
                collateral
            ];
            if (!validPair) {
                return;
            }
            address principle = informationOffers[i].principle;

            uint _currentEpoch = currentEpoch();

            lentAmountPerUserPerEpoch[lenders[i]][
                hashVariables(principle, _currentEpoch)
            ] += informationOffers[i].principleAmount;
            totalUsedTokenPerEpoch[principle][
                _currentEpoch
            ] += informationOffers[i].principleAmount;
            borrowAmountPerEpoch[borrower][
                hashVariables(principle, _currentEpoch)
            ] += informationOffers[i].principleAmount;

            emit UpdatedFunds(
                lenders[i],
                principle,
                collateral,
                borrower,
                _currentEpoch
            );
        }
    }
```

Here the protocol has two problems at once.
1. There is no protection against instant transactions.
That is nothing prevents the borrower to take flash loan on which after he will take credit, and then in the same transaction pay minimum interest to the protocol and lender. Thus, the borrower will simply squeeze a maximum number of shares in DebitaIncentivize and take as many rewards for this era as it would be profitable to cover flash loan.

2. What makes this attack even easier is that there is no check that the lender and borrower are not the same person. That is malicious user can also avoid costs for minimal apr.


### Root Cause

- No protection against instant loans
- Incentive has no maximum number of shares per person
- Lender and borrower can be the same person

### Internal pre-conditions

Someone should incentive a specific epoch

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The user sees big rewards in the current era.

He decides to get the most shares in this era.

For this he either takes flash loan, or uses his own funds and in one transaction rolls up a lot of instant loans according to the following scheme.

1. Create Borrow offer
2. Loan Lend offer
3. Match this offers (pay small taxes to protocol)
. Repay loan to yourself
5. Output collateral and principle
6. Go back to step 1

As long as the small fee that a user pays for such a round is less than the reward for a specific epoch, this action is beneficial.

### Impact

Ability to manipulate rewards in DebitaIncentivize. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix all root causes. Review design choices for DebitaIncentivize
