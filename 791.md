# Lack of `claimFees` functional on veNFTAerodrome receipts

### Summary

Users who own a veAERO NFT have access to all the functionality they would have if they had the NFT not in their contract, but on their own.

However, veNFTs also have a claimFees function, which the protocol did not provide access to. In turn, the claimFees function takes the rewards that users have received from Aerodrome swap commissions. That is, access to the funds is blocked due to insufficiently implemented functionality.

I am attaching a link to the [Voter AERODROME contract](https://basescan.org/address/0x16613524e02ad97eDfeF371bC883F2F5d6C480A5?__cf_chl_rt_tk=UwqGXqHRHZU0qYj.mG0xT4EcCF7ODY7sB1NDI4Q_js0-1732526377-1.0.1.1-Q8R50uZ2UoiiGCkEJKkA4v0.jrKrQmB8mpwJDi9KyU8#code), in its code you can find the claimFees function, it is right under claimBribes.

```solidity
    function claimFees(address[] memory _fees, address[][] memory _tokens, uint256 _tokenId) external {
        if (!IVotingEscrow(ve).isApprovedOrOwner(_msgSender(), _tokenId)) revert NotApprovedOrOwner();
        uint256 _length = _fees.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _length; i++) {
            IReward(_fees[i]).getReward(_tokenId, _tokens[i]);
        }
    }
```

### Root Cause

The protocol does not give access to all veAERO functionality for veAERO receipt holders

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users who will use veAERO receipt from Debita will lose access to funds that were earned from commissions for their veAERO. 

Thus, users will either be forced to withdraw NFT to brand them (this is problematic as their cheque may be on loan)

Or not to deposit NFTs at all - thus the protocol will lose liquidity.

I think since the protocol has implemented all the other functions, not implementing claimFees is not a designChoice, but a mistake on the part of the protocol.

Severity: medium

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add claimFees support
