# No Check for Sequencer Uptime Can Lead to Dutch Auctions Executing at Unfavorable Prices.

### Summary

Debita will be deployed on Arbitrum, Optimism, and other Layer 2 solutions, making it susceptible to sequencer downtime.

The `Auction` contract implements a Dutch auction mechanism with linear price decay, which can either recover debt from NFT collateral or allow users to sell NFTs via a Dutch auction. However, there is no check for sequencer uptime, which could result in auctions executing at unfavorable prices.

If the sequencer goes offline during the auction, the price will continue to decrease, even though no transactions can be processed. Once the sequencer comes back online, users may be able to purchase tokens from these auctions at significantly lower prices than the market price.

Auctions can be created by anyone using the `AuctionFactory::createAuction` function, with arbitrary values for `_initialAmount`, `_floorAmount`, and `_duration`. Alternatively, auctions can be used to liquidate loan collateral via `DebitaV3Loan::createAuctionForCollateral`. In this case, the parameters are set as follows:

- `_initialAmount = lockedAmount`
- `_floorAmount = 15% of _initialAmount`
- `_duration = 864,000 seconds (10 days)`

Network outages and large reorganizations occur with relative frequency. In 2022, the Arbitrum network suffered an outage of approximately [seven hours](https://cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-network-suffers-minor-outage-due-to-hardware-failure). A 78-minute outage also occurred in December 2023 [here](https://cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-network-goes-offline-december-15).

### Root Cause

In [Auction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L31) and [AuctionFactory](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L10) no check for sequencer uptime.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An auction is created either to liquidate a loan collateral or to simply sell an NFT via the Debita platform.

### External pre-conditions

1. Sequencer is down for a number of hours.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Any ongoing liquidations that are temporarily blocked by a sequencer outage will continue to experience price decay. When the sequencer goes back online, liquidation will have dropped significantly in price, causing liquidation to happen at an unfair price.

### PoC


To demonstrate the issue caused by the lack of a check for sequencer uptime, we’ll walk through a real-world scenario where the sequencer goes offline during a Dutch auction.

#### Auction Parameters

- **Initial Amount (`_initialAmount`)**: $1000 (representing Bob's debt).
- **Floor Amount (`_floorAmount`)**: $150 (15% of the initial amount).
- **Auction Duration (`_duration`)**: 864,000 seconds (10 days).
- **Sequencer Downtime**: 1 hour (3,600 seconds).

#### Scenario Breakdown

1. **Auction Begins**:
   - The auction starts with an initial price of $1000 for Bob’s collateral (NFT).
   - The price decays linearly from $1000 to $150 over the 10-day auction period.

2. **Sequencer Goes Offline**:
   - After 30 minutes (1,800 seconds) of the auction running, the sequencer goes offline.
   - During the 1-hour downtime (3,600 seconds), the auction price continues to decay, but no transactions can be processed, effectively "sticking" the auction at its offline state.

3. **Sequencer Comes Back Online**:
   - Once the sequencer returns online, the auction has decayed for a total of 1.5 hours (1,800 seconds of normal operation + 3,600 seconds of offline time).
   - The price will now be significantly lower than expected, as the auction continued to decay during the downtime.

4. **Auction Price Calculation**:
   - The auction price is determined by the elapsed time relative to the total auction duration. The decay is linear, so after 1.5 hours, the auction price will be reduced as follows:

$$
   \[
   \text{Price} = 1000 - \left( \frac{1000 - 150}{864000} \times 5400 \right) \approx 913.81
   \]
$$

   - At this point, the auction price is approximately **$913.81**, despite only 1.5 hours having passed.

5. **Impact of the Issue**:
   - The buyer can now purchase Bob’s collateral at a price much lower than originally intended.
   - Bob’s collateral is liquidated at this reduced price, and the buyer only needs to repay 91.38% of Bob's debt. If this were a collateral liquidation, the lender would receive less than expected.

The issue becomes even more severe when a user creates a short-duration auction on the Debita platform or when the sequencer downtime is longer than expected.

### Mitigation

Implement a sequencer uptime check and invalidate the auction if the sequencer was ever down during the auction period. This would ensure that the auction price is not unfairly affected by sequencer downtime.
