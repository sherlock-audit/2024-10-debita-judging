# Some Pinciple/Collateral token pair will not work due to rounding error in the DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3() function.

### Summary

In the DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3() function, there is a calculation of ratio of principle and collateral token.

However, in case of which the price of Collateral token is very small compared to the price of Principle token, borrower and lender's offer can't be matched because of rounding error.

### Root Cause

In the [DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:350](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L350-L361) function, there is a calculation of the ratio of 'priceCollateral_BorrowOrder' and 'pricePrinciple'.

To avoid floating, we multiply by 10^8 to get extra 8 decimals. However, floating can be occured when price of Collateral is too small compared to the price of Pinciple. For example, let's assume collateral token is BTC which is high price and principle token is Pepe which is low price. The ratio is calculated as following at current time:

priceCollateral_BorrowOrder * 10 ** 8 / pricePrinciple = 0.00002 * 10 ** 8 / 98000 = 0.


```solidity
     function matchOffersV3(
        address[] memory lendOrders,
        uint[] memory lendAmountPerOrder,
        uint[] memory porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder,
        address borrowOrder,
        address[] memory principles,
        uint[] memory indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder,
        uint[] memory indexForCollateral_LendOrder,
        uint[] memory indexPrinciple_LendOrder
    ) external nonReentrant returns (address) {

        ...

        /* 
        
        pricePrinciple / priceCollateral_BorrowOrder = 100% ltv (multiply by 10^8 to get extra 8 decimals to avoid floating)

        Example:
        collateral / principle
        1.45 / 2000 = 0.000725 nominal tokens of principle per collateral for 100% LTV                                        
        */
        uint principleDecimals = ERC20(principles[i]).decimals();

@>      uint ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = (priceCollateral_BorrowOrder *
                10 ** 8) / pricePrinciple;

        // take 100% of the LTV and multiply by the LTV of the principle
        uint value = (ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral *
            borrowInfo.LTVs[indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder[i]]) / 10000;

        /**
            get the ratio for the amount of principle the borrower wants to borrow
            fix the 8 decimals and get it on the principle decimals
        */
        uint ratio = (value * (10 ** principleDecimals)) / (10 ** 8);
        ratiosForBorrower[i] = ratio;

        ...
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The price of Collateral token is too small compared to the price of Principle token.  This is possible, since the protocol should interact with any ERC20 that follows exactly the standard.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Some Pinciple/Collateral token pair can not be used for this protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to use more extra decimals or multiply 'principleDecimals' at first.
