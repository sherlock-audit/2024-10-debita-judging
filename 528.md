### Attack Path

The address of the `aggregatorContract` contract in the `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory` contract can be updated by the admin via the `setAggregatorContract` function below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L201

```solidity
File: DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol
201:     function setAggregatorContract(address _aggregatorContract) external {
202:         require(aggregatorContract == address(0), "Already set");
203:         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set aggregator contract");
204:         aggregatorContract = _aggregatorContract;
205:     }
```

When the Borrow Offer is created and initialized, the current `aggregatorContract` address is passed in, as shown in Line 109 below. Assume that the current `aggregatorContract` address is $X$.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L109

```solidity
File: DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol
075:     function createBorrowOrder(
..SNIP..
106:         DBOImplementation borrowOffer = new DBOImplementation();
107: 
108:         borrowOffer.initialize(
109:             aggregatorContract,
110:             msg.sender,
111:             _acceptedPrinciples,
```

The `aggregatorContract` address of $X$ will be cached within the Borrow Offer contract, as shown in Line 82 below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L98

```solidity
File: DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol
65:     function initialize(
66:         address _aggregatorContract,
..SNIP..
81:     ) public initializer {
82:         aggregatorContract = _aggregatorContract;
83:         isActive = true;
```

Assume at some point of time later, when the admin updates to the new aggregator address called $Y$.

The issue is that all the existing borrow offers will still point to the invalid and outdated aggregator address of $X$ Instead of the updated $Y$. In addition, there is no function with the borrow offer contract to update the cached aggregator address to the updated $Y$.

This issue also affects the following contracts and lending offers:

- [`DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L49) and [`DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L18)

When this issue occurs, all affected borrow offers are effectively useless and cannot be matched because when the Borrow Offer's `acceptBorrowOffer` function is executed by the new aggregator, the `onlyAggregator` modifier will always revert because it is still pointing to the outdated/invalid aggregator.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L137

```solidity
File: DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol
133:     /**
134:      * @dev Accepts the borrow offer -- only callable from Aggregator
135:      * @param amount Amount of the collateral to be accepted
136:      */
137:     function acceptBorrowOffer(
138:         uint amount
139:     ) public onlyAggregator nonReentrant onlyAfterTimeOut {
```

When this issue occurs, all affected lending offers are effectively useless and cannot be matched because when the Lending Offer's `acceptLendingOffer` function is executed by the new aggregator, the `onlyAggregator` modifier will always revert because it is still pointing to the outdated/invalid aggregator.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L109

```solidity
File: DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol
107:     // function to accept the lending offer
108:     // only aggregator can call this function
109:     function acceptLendingOffer(
110:         uint amount
111:     ) public onlyAggregator nonReentrant onlyAfterTimeOut {
```

### Impact

Medium. Breaks core contract functionality and renders all existing lending and borrow order contracts useless

Note that due to the newly updated Sherlock's judging rules (shown below), issues that the admin might unknowingly cause when updating a state variable, such as the issue described here, are considered valid.

> Note: if the (external) admin will unknowingly cause issues, it can be considered a valid issue.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow the owner of the lending and borrow orders to update the aggregator's address.
