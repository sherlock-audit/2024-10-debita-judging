# buyNFT is vulnerable to front-running attack.

### Summary

The [DutchAuction_veNFT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L31) contract follows Dutch Auction system which means auction starts with a high price and the price decreases at certain interval until the price seems reasonable for someone to bid. Instead of directly buying the NFT an attacker can just wait for someone to signal that they are interested in buying the NFT and after seeing the signal the attacker can call [DutchAuction_veNFT.buyNFT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L109) and frontrun the legit buyer by providing more gas or reordering(in case the attacker is a miner) the transaction list giving his transaction higher priority.

### Root Cause

The [DutchAuction_veNFT.buyNFT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L109) function is as follows: 
```solidity
    function buyNFT() public onlyActiveAuction {
        // get memory data
        dutchAuction_INFO memory m_currentAuction = s_CurrentAuction;
        // get current price of the auction
        uint currentPrice = getCurrentPrice();
        // desactivate auction from storage
        s_CurrentAuction.isActive = false;
        uint fee;
        if (m_currentAuction.isLiquidation) {
            fee = auctionFactory(factory).auctionFee();
        } else {
            fee = auctionFactory(factory).publicAuctionFee();
        }

        // calculate fee
        uint feeAmount = (currentPrice * fee) / 10000;
        // get fee address
        address feeAddress = auctionFactory(factory).feeAddress();
        // Transfer liquidation token from the buyer to the owner of the auction
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
            msg.sender,
            s_ownerOfAuction,
            currentPrice - feeAmount
        );

        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
            msg.sender,
            feeAddress,
            feeAmount
        );

        // If it's a liquidation, handle it properly
        if (m_currentAuction.isLiquidation) {
            debitaLoan(s_ownerOfAuction).handleAuctionSell(
                currentPrice - feeAmount
            );
        }
        IERC721 Token = IERC721(s_CurrentAuction.nftAddress);
        Token.safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            msg.sender,
            s_CurrentAuction.nftCollateralID
        );

        auctionFactory(factory)._deleteAuctionOrder(address(this));
        auctionFactory(factory).emitAuctionDeleted(
            address(this),
            s_ownerOfAuction
        );
        // event offerBought
    }
```
Anyone can calculate the current price of the NFT and monitor who has sent transaction to `buyNFT` function.

### Attack Path

Attacker type: miner or a normal account with high gas price.

1. Instead of buying the NFT at current price attacker waits for someone to show interest in the NFT.
2. Attacker monitors any transaction that shows someone sent an approval call to the sellingToken contract or to [DutchAuction_veNFT.buyNFT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L109). 
3. Attacker constructs similar transaction and broadcast it with higher gas price or reorders(in case the attacker is a miner) the transaction list giving his transaction higher priority. 
4. Attacker wins the auction and the legit bidder's transaction fails. 

### Impact

1. Normal legit bidders might loose interest in the auction leaving only the miners to bid.
2. Since there aren't many competitors the auctioned NFT is at the risk of selling at floor price. The NFT seller will loose money. 

### PoC
N/A

### Mitigation

Introduce `commit-reveal scheme` or any other mechanism so the legit interested buyers can buy the NFT.
