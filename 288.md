# `ChainlinkOracle` doesn't validate for `minAnswer/maxAnswer`

### Summary

Chainlink still has feeds that uses the `min/maxAnswer` to limit the range of values and hence in case of a price crash, incorrect price will be used to value the assets allowing user's to exploit this incorrectness by depositing the overvalued asset and borrowing against it.
Since the protocol will be deployed on Arbitrum, Here are a few examples of tokens that return a minAnswer on `Arbitrum`
1. [AAVE / USD minAnswer = 100000000](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3c6AbdA21358c15601A3175D8dd66D0c572cc904#readContract)
2. [AVAX / USD minAnswer = 10000000](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf17b68a40f10d3DcEedd9a092F1Df331cE3D9da#readContract)


### Root Cause

The `DebitaChainlink::getThePrice` function does not verify if the returned price is within the bounds the `minAnswer/maxAnswer` of the specific token.

```solidity
    function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

There is a drop in price of the Token

### Attack Path

1. Price of the token falls below the `minAnswer`
2. Deposit the collateral token at the inflated price returned by chainlink (minAnswer)
3. Borrow the maximum amount for an asset, the issue is that the borrowed amount will be worth more than the collateral, this causes loss for the lender

### Impact

Users will borrow an amount worth more than the collateral, this causes a huge fund loss for lenders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If the price is outside the minPrice/maxPrice of the oracle, ensure the returned value is not used and revert with the appropriate errors
