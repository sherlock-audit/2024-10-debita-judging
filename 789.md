`DebitaChainlink::getThePrice()` doesn't check for stale price. As result protocol can make decisions based on not up to date prices, which can cause loses.

Note

Regarding to contest `README` :

> Each oracle will have a MANAGER role. We will have a bot constantly monitoring the price of pairs. If there is a difference greater than 5%, the oracle will be paused until it stabilizes again.
> 

Even though there are bots that keep prices in the range of `+= 5%`, this does not guarantee that the price used is the latest updated price because it is possible that the price used is an outdated price but is still in the range, `-5% < price < +5%`.
