# The chainlink oracle doesn't check if min/max answers are within the specified threshold

### Summary

The protocol will use 3 oracles for price retrievement and one of them is Chainlink oracle. However some Chainlink aggregators have a built-in circuit breaker to check if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined range. The reason for that is, if the price of an asset has a major drop in value the returned price from the oracle will continue to return the predetermined `minAnswer` instead of the actual price. An example would be the exploit of the [Venus Protocol & Blizz Finance](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/) when LUNA crashed. Here we can see that min/max ranges are not validated also:

```javascript
 function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        ...
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        ...
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```

In the README is mentioned that the protocol will be deployed on Arbitrum also, so here are few examples that return `min/maxAnswer`:

1. AAVE/USD - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3c6AbdA21358c15601A3175D8dd66D0c572cc904#readContract
2. AVAX/USD - https://arbiscan.io/address/0xcf17b68a40f10d3DcEedd9a092F1Df331cE3D9da#readContract
3. SOL/USD - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8C4308F7cbD7fB829645853cD188500D7dA8610a#readContract
4. ETH/USD - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3607e46698d218B3a5Cae44bF381475C0a5e2ca7#readContract


### Root Cause

Not validating the predetermined thresholds by the aggregators

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This will allow orders to be matched by retrieving the wrong prices of the collaterals and principal amounts, hence can result in completely drained aggregator contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement the required checks:

```javascript
price >= minAnswer and price <= maxAnswer
```
