# Auctioned `taxTokenReceipt` will be permanently locked in the `auction` contract

### Summary

A `receiptID` created through the `taxTokensReceipt` function, if auctioned, becomes permanently unsellable as it will revert when calling the `safeTransferFrom()` function.

The `taxTokensReceipt` contract is designed to wrap unusual ERC20 tokens, like Fee-on-Transfer (FoT) tokens, into an NFT. This concept is similar to `receiptVeNFTs`, except that instead of wrapping an NFT, it wraps ERC20 tokens with unique behaviors. For FoT tokens, transfers require careful handling to ensure that transfers are not allowed free of charge.

In `taxTokensReceipt`, the [`transferFrom()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L93) function is overridden to enforce that either the `from` or `to` address must belong to a `loan`, `borrowOffer`, or `lendOffer`. This mechanism works as intended throughout most of the protocol. However, issues arise when an NFT from `taxTokenReceipts` is used as collateral in a loan and subsequently needs to be auctioned. During an auction, no one can buy the NFT because neither the sender nor the receiver of the `transferFrom()` function (called within `buyNFT()`) qualifies as a `loan`, `borrowOffer`, or `lendOffer`.

The only way to recover the NFT would be to cancel the auction and return the NFT to the `loan` contract. However, this is not feasible because the [`cancelAuction()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L168) function is restricted to `onlyOwner`, and the `loan` contract lacks any hooks to manage such a scenario. As a result, the NFT becomes permanently locked within the `auction` contract.

### Root Cause

In the `transferFrom()` function overridden by `taxTokensReceipts`, there is no check to verify if the sender or receiver is an auction, such as by using the mapping [`isAuction[addressAuction]`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L22).


### Internal pre-conditions

- FoT tokens are wrapped in a `taxTokensReceipt` NFT.
- A loan is created using this NFT as collateral with multiple lenders involved.
- The loan defaults, and the NFT is subsequently auctioned.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- The borrower wraps their FoT tokens into `taxTokensReceipt` and receives an NFT receipt for the wrapped amount.
- The borrower then creates a loan with multiple lenders, using this NFT receipt as collateral.
- At the end of the loan, the borrower decides not to repay, leading to the NFT receipt representing the FoT tokens being put up for auction.
- The NFT remains permanently locked in the auction contract because any attempt to purchase it results in a revert during the `safeTransferFrom()` function. Furthermore, you cannot cancel the auction due to missing hooks in the loan contract..


### Impact

`taxtokensReceipts` NFTs permanently locked when auctioned.

### Mitigation

Modify the `transferFrom()` function by using the mapping `isAuction[addressAuction]`. This ensures that if either the receiver or the sender is an auction, the transfer will pass:

Add the interface of auction factory outside the contract:
```diff
+   interface IAuctionFactoryDebita {
+       function isAuction(
+           address _auction
+       ) external view returns (bool);
+   }  
```

Add the auction factory address through the constructor:
```diff
+   address public auctionFactory;
    constructor(
        address _token,
        address _borrowOrderFactory,
        address _lendOrderFactory,
        address _aggregator
+       address _auctionFactory
    ) ERC721("TaxTokensReceipts", "TTR") {
        tokenAddress = _token;
        borrowOrderFactory = _borrowOrderFactory;
        lendOrderFactory = _lendOrderFactory;
        Aggregator = _aggregator;
+       auctionFactory = _auctionFactory;
    }
```

Add the changes to the `transferFrom()`:
```diff
function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) public virtual override(ERC721, IERC721) {
        bool isReceiverAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(to) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(to) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(to) ||
+           IAuctionFactoryDebita(auctionFactory).isAuction(to);
        bool isSenderAddressDebita = IBorrowOrderFactory(borrowOrderFactory)
            .isBorrowOrderLegit(from) ||
            ILendOrderFactory(lendOrderFactory).isLendOrderLegit(from) ||
            IAggregator(Aggregator).isSenderALoan(from) ||
+           IAuctionFactoryDebita(auctionFactory).isAuction(from);
        // Debita not involved --> revert
        require(
            isReceiverAddressDebita || isSenderAddressDebita,
            "TaxTokensReceipts: Debita not involved"
        );
        if (to == address(0)) {
            revert ERC721InvalidReceiver(address(0));
        }
        // Setting an "auth" arguments enables the `_isAuthorized` check which verifies that the token exists
        // (from != 0). Therefore, it is not needed to verify that the return value is not 0 here.
        address previousOwner = _update(to, tokenId, _msgSender());
        if (previousOwner != from) {
            revert ERC721IncorrectOwner(from, tokenId, previousOwner);
        }
    }
```
