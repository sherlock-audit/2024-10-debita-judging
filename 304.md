# DebitaChainlink doesn't validate minAnswer/maxAnswer

### Summary

According to the readme the protocol will be deployed to Optimism
>On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?

The current implementation of the ``DebitaChainlink.sol`` contract doesn't validate the minAnswer/maxAnswer as can be seen from the [getThePrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L30-L47) function:

```solidity
    function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```
It only checks whether the price is bigger than 0. However most of the data feeds on Optimism still return minAnswer/maxAnswer.

For example: 
- The USDT/USD data feed [aggregator contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xAc37790fF4aBf9483fAe2D1f62fC61fE6b8E4789#readContract), we can still see that the returned minAnswer is **1000000**
- The BTC/USD data feed [aggregator contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x0C1272d2aC652D10d03bb4dEB0D31F15ea3EAb2b#readContract), we can still see that the returned minAnswer is **10000000000**

Most of the data feeds on OP function in this way, given that the protocol is expected to work with a lot of different tokens, this will be problematic.

### Root Cause

Missing minAnswer/maxAnswer check in the [getThePrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L30-L47) function.

### Impact

If a scenario similar to the LUNA crash happens again, for example the USDT/USD pair will be returning prices that are bigger than the actual price. If users utilize oracles and LTVs to get their desired ratio, and the actual USDT/USD price is less than the minAnswer returned from the data feed, borrowers will receive much less USDT tokens for the collateral they are providing, than they are supposed to.
