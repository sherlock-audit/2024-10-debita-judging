# Later deadline lender might liquidate borrower's collateral before their `maxDeadline` due to `claimCollateralAsLender` function checking earliest deadline of the lender.

### Summary

When the borrower calls `extendLoan` function then the repay time extends with lender's `maxDeadline`, if they all not have been paid yet. However the `claimCollateralAsLender` function can be called by all lender, if the earliest deadline has been passed among all the lender. So the problem is other lenders might forcefully call this function to liqiuidate borrower's collateral before their `maxDeadline`. 

The purpose of the `maxDeadine` is that any borrower can repay lender's debt within this time period, and his collateral should not be liquidated before that time. 

### Root Cause

The `claimCollateralAsLender` function checks the time to liquidate the borrower collateral by earliest lender's `maxdeadline` among all lenders. 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The lenders can call the `claimCollateralAsLender` function right after a borrower misses earliest lender repayment time.

### Impact

The lenders might forcefully liquidate borrowers collateral before their `maxDeadline`.

Run following command -> `forge test --fork-url https://mainnet.base.org --fork-block-number 21151256 --match-test "testFlareLenderClaimsCollateralBeforeDeadline" --force -vvvv`

```solidity
   function testFlareLenderClaimsCollateralBeforeDeadline() public{

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 8640000);
        
        // since the other two lender has maxDeadline  is 9640000, but still they can liquidate before that time. 
        vm.startPrank(secondLender);
        DebitaV3LoanContract.claimCollateralAsLender(1);
        vm.stopPrank();

### Mitigation
Allow lenders to claim borrower collateral only when their `maxdeadline` to repay has elapsed.
