# TaxTokenReceipt does not support fee on transfer tokens as it supposed to do

### Summary

Letâ€™s consider the function [`TaxTokensReceipts::deposit'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L59)
```solidity
function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
        return tokenID;
    }
```

```solidity
uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
```
According to the README of the content this function should support FOT tokens. However, as you can see, it does not support because the check will never be true for FOT tokens.

The difference can never be more than the sent amount. It can only be equal - but not in case of token FOT.

Thus, this contract supports only regular tokens, and any deposit FOT token will be revert.


### Root Cause

The difference can never be more than amount - sent to contract.

For FOT tokens it will always be smaller.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Contract that should have supported FOT tokens - does not support FOT tokens. Broken protocol functionality - high severity



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove this check, it blocks FOT tokens.
