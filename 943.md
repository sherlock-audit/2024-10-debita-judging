# Setting wrong fee address could lead to loss of fees

### Summary

In `AuctionFactory.sol`, the owner can change/set the `feeAddress`, address to which the fees is sent. 

There is no check for zero addresses or 2 step transfer mechanism to prevent setting a wrong address by mistake. 

This could lead to a loss of funds as the fees collected could be burned or sent to a wrong address.

### Root Cause

The owner can set the `feeAddress` by calling `setFeeAddress(address)` in `AuctionFactory.sol`. In [line 215](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L215), the fee address is simply set to the address passed to the function without any checks.

```solidity
    function setFeeAddress(address _feeAddress) public onlyOwner {
        feeAddress = _feeAddress;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If by mistake, the address passed here is a zero address, the fees would get burned. 

If it is some other address, the fee would be lost to an unintended recipient.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add a zero address check
- Add a two step verification mechanism (something similar to OpenZeppelin's [Ownable2Step](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/access#Ownable2Step))

Note that a two step verification mechanism would come with it's own overhead. The decision to implement it should be taken by considering the relevant technical & financial tradeoffs.
