# Lack of Dynamic Adjustment for Maximum Interest Rate Based on Chain Parameters

### Summary

A fixed maximum interest rate (_maxInterestRate) in the smart contract may cause **incorrect interest rates or loan denial** for **borrowers and lenders** as **the system cannot account for varying block times across different chains.**

### Root Cause

In the function **`createBorrowOrder`**, the **_maxInterestRate** parameter is not dynamically adjusted based on the block time of the chain. This creates a mismatch between the intended interest rate and its actual effect due to varying chain environments.  

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L75

Example:  
If `_maxInterestRate = 0.01`, it translates differently depending on block time:  
- Ethereum (12 seconds/block): ≈73% annual rate  
- Binance Smart Chain (3 seconds/block): ≈292% annual rate  

This disparity can unintentionally lead to excessive interest rates or underperformance of loans.  

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The borrower initializes a borrow order with a fixed `_maxInterestRate`.  
2. The chain's block time is significantly different from the assumed block time in the contract's logic.  

### External pre-conditions

1. The chain’s block time (external protocol factor) does not match the assumed average block time.  
2. The borrowing or lending ecosystem relies on consistent interest rate calculations.  

### Attack Path

This issue is conceptual, but the lack of adjustments may create unfavorable outcomes:  
1. A borrower sets a `_maxInterestRate` they find acceptable (e.g., 5%).  
2. Due to shorter block times, the actual annualized interest rate becomes far higher than intended.  
3. Borrowers unknowingly enter unfavorable loan agreements or lenders receive lower returns.  

### Impact

- **Borrowers** may face **unexpectedly high interest rates**, discouraging platform use.  
- **Lenders** may find it difficult to assess the profitability of their loans.  
- The platform risks **loss of trust and adoption**.  

### PoC

The example below demonstrates how the fixed `_maxInterestRate` causes an unintended annualized interest rate on chains with varying block times:  

```solidity
// Example borrow order creation  
createBorrowOrder(  
    ...  
    _maxInterestRate = 0.005 ether, // 0.5% per block  
    _duration = 30 days  
);  
```  
Assume `_maxInterestRate` is interpreted as **0.5% per block**:  
1. Ethereum: Annual rate ≈ 157% (12 sec/block)  
2. Binance Smart Chain: Annual rate ≈ 630% (3 sec/block)  


### Mitigation

1. Dynamically calculate and enforce **_maxInterestRate** based on the chain's block time:  
   ```solidity
   uint chainAdjustedRate = (_maxInterestRate * averageBlockTime) / expectedBlockTime;
   ```  
   Use this adjusted rate for calculations.  

2. Introduce a configuration function to allow protocol admins to set the expected block time for the target chain.  

3. Validate interest rates dynamically in **`createBorrowOrder`** to ensure they align with protocol limits:  
   ```solidity
   require(adjustedRate <= protocolMaxRate, "Interest rate exceeds protocol limits");
   ```  

This ensures the protocol remains chain-agnostic and fair for all participants.
