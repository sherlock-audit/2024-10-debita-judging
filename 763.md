# Wrong Formula to calculate LTV in `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3` will Cause Lenders to Lose Money

### Summary

The [`DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274) is used to match a borrow order with multiple lend orders. If the lend order or borrow order uses oracles to fetch live data, their LTV calculation for the loan will be wrong. This will cause the borrowers to lose money substantially because the LTV formula is flipped from the original formula. 

### Root Cause

The [`matchOffersV3`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274) is used to match a borrow offer with multiple lend offers. This is done by calculating the LTV ratio for both borrow and lend offers and ensuring that both parties are happy with their loan. 

The `ratio` calculated for both borrow and lend offers in the function is using the wrong formula. For example, for the [borrow offer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L350): 

```solidity
@> uint ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = (priceCollateral_BorrowOrder *
                        10 ** 8) / pricePrinciple;

uint value = (ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral *
                    borrowInfo.LTVs[indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder[i]]) / 10000;
uint ratio = (value * (10 ** principleDecimals)) / (10 ** 8);
                ratiosForBorrower[i] = ratio;
```

For each [lending offer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L451): 

```solidity
@> uint fullRatioPerLending = (priceCollateral_LendOrder *
                    10 ** 8) / pricePrinciple;
uint maxValue = (fullRatioPerLending *
                    lendInfo.maxLTVs[collateralIndex]) / 10000;
uint principleDecimals = ERC20(principles[principleIndex])
                    .decimals();
maxRatio = (maxValue * (10 ** principleDecimals)) / (10 ** 8);

...

uint ratio = (maxRatio * porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder[i]) / 10000;
```

The reason the above formulas are wrong is proven in the following [line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L453): 
```solidity
uint maxValue = (fullRatioPerLending *
                    lendInfo.maxLTVs[collateralIndex]) / 10000;
```

Let's look at that a little more closely: 

$$maxValue = \frac{fullRatioPerLending \times maxLTV}{10000}$$

This function is trying to calculate the maximum allowed value of a loan based on the user set `maxLTV` in the `LendInfo` and similarly the allowed value of a loan based on the user set `LTV` in the `BorrowInfo`. 

Presumably, the user will think that the `LTV` calculation formula will be the following based on all sources of definitions: [In traditional accounting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loantovalue.asp), and [in web3 accounting](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/loan-to-value-ltv): 

$$LTV = \frac{LoanAmount}{MarketValueOfCollateral}$$

In the current function, the formula needs to be: 
```solidity
uint ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = (pricePrinciple  *
                        10 ** 8) / priceCollateral_BorrowOrder;
```

### How does this affect the user? 
To answer that question let's understand what the respective formulas are calculating: 
*Original Formula:* 

$$maxValue = \frac{priceCollateral}{pricePrinciple} \times maxLTV_{Lender}$$

This function calculates the maximum value of this particular Lend Order, and it is understood as the **maximum price of Collateral per price of Principle**. 
In other words, how much maximum collateral that needs to be present per loan given out. 
For example: a `maxValue` of `0.5` in this case means that for every `$1` in collateral, you can take out `$2` in loan principle. 
In this case `maxValue > 1` is better than `maxValue < 1`

*Corrected Formula:*

$$maxValue = \frac{pricePrinciple}{priceCollateral} \times maxLTV_{Lender}$$

This function will calculate the maximum value of this Lend Order as the **maximum price of the Principle per price of Collateral**. 
In other words, how much maximum loan can you take out per collateral available. 
For example: a `maxValue` of `0.5` in this case means that for every `$1` in loan principle, you will have `$2` in collateral. 
In this case `maxValue < 1` is better than `maxValue > 1`

Both formulas work perfectly if it is implemented consistently across the board. This is not true because the `LendOffer` asks `maxLTVs` per collateral, `BorrowOffer` asks for `LTVs` for each principle-collateral token they would like to accept, but the `matchOffersV3` calculates `VTL` and multiplies it with `LTV`. 

So, a user might think they want their loan to have `80:100 = 0.8` `LTV` ratio, in other words for every `$80` in loan, they want `$100` in collateral just to be safe. 
On the other hand, according to the current implementation of the function, the user's `0.8` `LTV` function will get them `$80` collateral, for every `$100` loan. 

As you can see, this can be troublesome when loans default and the user gets less collateral back than they set.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker will see a lend order from Alice for `$10,000` with `90%` maxLTV using either Chainlink or Pyth Oracle. 
2. The attacker will create a borrow order for `$10,000` with `90%` LTV. 
3. The attacker will call the `matchOffersV3` function with the borrow and lend offers. 
4. Attacker will receive the `$10,000` from Alice. 
5. Attacker will default on the loan. 
6. Alice will claim the collateral, but instead of getting a collateral valued at `$11,111` like she should have, she will get a collateral valued at `$9,000`. 
7. Attacker gains `$1,000`, Alice loses `$1,000`. 

### Impact

The attacker will make the following profit in each lend order they match with: 

$$profit = (1 - LTV) \times loanPrinciple$$

So, for a loan of `$10,000`: 
`LTV = 0.8; Profit = $2000`
`LTV = 0.7; Profit = $3000` 
`LTV = 0.1; Profit = $1000`

A lower LTV rate is considered a safer investment, but with the current setup, **a lower LTV increase the risk substantially**.
