# User can add funds to inactive lending offers, causing fund mismanagement

### Summary

The missing `isActive` status check in the `addFunds` function will cause improper fund management for lenders, as users can add funds to lending offers that are inactive.



### Root Cause

in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L149, the addFunds function does not verify if isActive is `true` before allowing users to add funds. This omission allows users to add funds even when the lending offer is inactive.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The lending offer has isActive set to `false`
2. Users have access to call the addFunds function.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The lending offer is deactivated (isActive = false).
2 .A user calls the addFunds function on the inactive lending offer.
3. The function accepts the funds without checking the isActive status.
4. Funds are added to the inactive lending offer, which may lead to funds being locked or mismanaged.

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

```solidity
// Assume we have an instance of the inactive lending offer contract
DebitaLendOffer lendOffer = DebitaLendOffer(inactiveLendingOfferAddress);

// User attempts to add funds to the inactive offer
uint256 amountToAdd = 1000 ether;
lendOffer.addFunds(amountToAdd);

// The addFunds function does not check if `isActive` is true
// Funds are accepted and added to the inactive lending offer
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
function addFunds(uint256 amount) external {
    require(isActive, "Lending offer is not active");
    // Rest of the function logic
}
```
