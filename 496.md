# Changing owner of the `AuctionFactory` is impossible because it uses incorrect variable

### Summary

In the `AuctionFactory.changeOwner` function, the variable name of input parameter is same as contract owner variable name.
This causes changing owner revert.

### Root Cause

In the `AuctionFactory` contract, the `owner` variable refers to the owner's address of the contract.
In the [changeOwner](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/tree/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218), it also uses the same input variable name, `owner`.

```solidity
L37:    address owner; // owner of the contract
        constructor() {
L44:        owner = msg.sender;
            feeAddress = msg.sender;
            deployedTime = block.timestamp;
        }
L218:   function changeOwner(address owner) public {
            require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
            require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
            owner = owner;
        }
```

As a result, within the function, `owner` is treated as a local variable, making it impossible to change the owner.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

- Alice is owner of the contract and she is going to delegate owner to Bob.
- The input parameter is Bob's address and `msg.sender` is Alice.
As a result, this reverts by the `require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner")`.

### Impact

Changing owner of the `AuctionFactory` is impossible because it uses incorrect variable

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

```diff
-   function changeOwner(address owner) public {
+   function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
-       owner = owner;
+       owner = _owner;
    }
```
