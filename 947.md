# An attacker can bypass the maxApr limit to gain higher profits

### Summary

The calculation of APR is performed using weighted averaging and is rounded down. This can result in a situation where the actual APR exceeds maxApr, but due to the rounding down, the computed value becomes 0. An attacker can exploit this by providing a very high weight value as the denominator for (lendInfo.apr * lendAmountPerOrder[i]) / amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex]. Subsequently, the attacker can increase the APR and set lendAmountPerOrder to a very small value. By doing so, the attacker can manipulate a significant portion of a borrowInfo's borrowAmount to match at an APR exceeding maxApr, causing losses to the borrower.

### Root Cause

The issue arises in the following code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L490-L491

Here, the APR is calculated using weights, and the orders at the front affect the subsequent calculations. The larger the value of the earlier orders, the more the later values are impacted by precision issues.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The attacker must provide an array where the first value is significantly large to cause greater precision loss in the subsequent weighted calculations.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls matchOffersV3 to initiate order matching and sets the APR of the first lend order to borrowInfo.maxApr. For the subsequent lend orders, they can set the APR very high but keep the lendAmountPerOrder very small, causing the calculated value to be 0.

### Impact

The borrower's APR can exceed the maxApr limit and be set to an arbitrary value.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of using a weighted average APR, it is recommended to use a simple average APR or perform a check on each individual APR.
