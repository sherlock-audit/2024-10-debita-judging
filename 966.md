# Lender can loose collateral in DebitaV3Loan when auction is not initialized

### Summary

When a loan with nft collateral has been defaulted, a lender attempting to claim their collateral before the collateral has been autioned will loose their collateral and their ability to re-claim it later on( i.e. after it has been auctioned)


### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan::claimCollateralAsLender` calls the `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` function to claim the collateral is an NFT.
The `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` function returns `true` when the claim is successful and `false` when the claim is not successful.

 The issue is that the calling finction (`DebitaV3Loan::claimCollateralAsLender`) does not handle the case where the claim is not successful as a result the `lendoffer.collateralClaimed` will be `true` even though the lender did not claim the collateral and they'll be unable to claim it again.
