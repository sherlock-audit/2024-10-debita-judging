# The Overshadowing Oversight in `changeOwner` Function"

### Summary

The `AuctionFactory.sol` and `buyorderfactory.sol` contract contains a critical vulnerability in the `changeOwner` function due to variable overshadowing. The function's parameter owner overshadows the state variable owner, preventing the intended update of the contract's ownership. This issue can lead to operational risks, including the inability to transfer ownership, which is essential for protocol governance and security.



### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue in the changeOwner function is variable overshadowing. This occurs when a local variable or parameter within a function shares the same name as a state variable, causing the local variable to take precedence within the function's scope. In this case, the parameter owner in the changeOwner function overshadows the contract's state variable owner. Consequently, any reference to owner within the function refers to the parameter rather than the state variable. As a result, the assignment owner = owner; fails to update the state variable and instead assigns the parameter to itself, effectively doing nothing. This overshadowing prevents the function from performing its intended task of updating the contract's owner, leading to potential operational and governance issues within the protocol. To resolve this, the parameter should be renamed (e.g., to newOwner) to ensure the function can correctly reference and update the state variable.

### Impact

Ownership Stagnation: The contract's owner cannot be changed due to the overshadowing issue, which can prevent necessary administrative updates.
Protocol Functionality Dependency: Various protocol functionalities may rely on the owner for critical operations, such as updating parameters, managing access controls, and executing administrative tasks. The inability to update the owner due to overshadowing can lead to operational bottlenecks and hinder the protocol's adaptability to changing circumstances.
Operational Risk and Misleading Assumptions: A user intending to close their association with the protocol might attempt to transfer ownership, believing the function call to be successful due to the lack of error feedback and absence of an event indicating failure. The previous owner, assuming the transfer was successful, might lose access to their account, resulting in a bricked ownership. This scenario leaves the protocol without an active owner, potentially leading to unmanaged states and vulnerabilities.

### Mitigation

Add a event and improve the code 

```solidity
event OwnerChanged(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);

function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    emit OwnerChanged(owner, newOwner);
    owner = newOwner;
}
```
