# Borrowers may fail to extend loans because of the incorrect minFEE

### Summary

When we calculate the `feeOfMaxDeadline`, we use the incorrect minimum fee. This may cause revert when we calculate `misingBorrowFee`.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Loan:extendLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L606), borrowers can extend their loan. We will calculate `feeOfMaxDeadline` and the `feeOfMaxDeadline` should be in one range. We should make sure that `feeOfMaxDeadline` is between `minFEE` and `maxFee`.
The problem is that when we check the minimum fee, we use `feePerDay` not `minFEE`. This may cause revert when we calculate the `misingBorrowFee`.
For example, we use the default value for feePerDay = 4, minFEE = 20:
1. The loan's initial duration is 2 days. Borrowers pay the minFEE. `PorcentageOfFeePaid` = minFEE = 20
2. Now the borrower extends the loan from 2 dyas to 4 days. `feeOfMaxDeadline` = 16. In [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3-0x37-web3/issues/10),  I describe the incorrect feeOfMaxDeadline's calculation. Here we assume we've already fixed that issue.
3. When we calculate the `misingBorrowFee`, we will revert.
```solidity
                if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
                    uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /
                        86400);
                    if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
                        feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
                    } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) {
@>                        feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
                    }
@>                    misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
                }
```
```solidity
        uint PorcentageOfFeePaid = ((m_loan.initialDuration * feePerDay) /
            86400);
        // adjust fees

        if (PorcentageOfFeePaid > maxFee) {
            PorcentageOfFeePaid = maxFee;
        } else if (PorcentageOfFeePaid < minFEE) {
@>            PorcentageOfFeePaid = minFEE;
        }
```

### Attack Path

1. The loan's initial duration is 2 days. Borrowers pay the minFEE. `PorcentageOfFeePaid` = minFEE = 20
2. Now the borrower extends the loan from 8 hours to 4 days. `feeOfMaxDeadline` = 16. In [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3-0x37-web3/issues/10),  I describe the incorrect feeOfMaxDeadline's calculation. Here we assume we've already fixed that issue.
3. When we calculate the `misingBorrowFee`, we will revert.

### Impact

Borrowers may fail to extend their loan because of incorrect minimum fee.
