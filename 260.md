# Protocol doesn't take into account DOS in the case of Chainlick Oracle goes down or Chainlick blocks access to price feeds

### Summary

In extreme cases such as Chainlick feeds going down, and/or considering that Chainlink’s “multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will" `DebitaChainlink::getThePrice` function will be rendered useless and the protocol will not be able to function.

### Root Cause

`DebitaChainlink::getThePrice` function doesn't take into account that Chainlink oracle can go offline, or their multisig can decide to block access to price feeds at will, as they can do that.

```solidity
    function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int256) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
        //@audit doesn't check stale data
        (, int256 price,,,) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```

In such cases, the protocol's cardinal function `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3` will not work, leaving the protocol unusable for the moment as it makes use of this functionality in various places:

### Mitigation

Consider using a try/catch block in `DebitaChainlink::getThePrice` function and handle accordingly.
