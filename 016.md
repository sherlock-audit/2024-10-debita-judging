# Borrower can bypass the condition checks during matching using reentrancy.

### Summary

Borrower can bypass the condition checks during matching using reentrancy.

### Root Cause

- The [DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L274-L647) function checks the borrow offer's conditions (e.g., duration) against those of lend offers before calling `DBOImplementation.acceptBorrowOffer()` and finally creating a loan with the borrow offer's condition.
```solidity
    function matchOffersV3(
        address[] memory lendOrders,
        uint[] memory lendAmountPerOrder,
        uint[] memory porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder,
        address borrowOrder,
        address[] memory principles,
        uint[] memory indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder,
        uint[] memory indexForCollateral_LendOrder,
        uint[] memory indexPrinciple_LendOrder
    ) external nonReentrant returns (address) {
        ...... SKIP ......
            // check that the duration is between the min and max duration from the lend order
            require(
@>              borrowInfo.duration >= lendInfo.minDuration &&
                    borrowInfo.duration <= lendInfo.maxDuration,
                "Invalid duration"
            );
        ...... SKIP ......
@>      DBOImplementation(borrowOrder).acceptBorrowOffer(
            borrowInfo.isNFT ? 1 : amountOfCollateral
        );
        ...... SKIP ......
        DebitaV3Loan deployedLoan = DebitaV3Loan(address(_loanProxy));
        // init loan
        deployedLoan.initialize(
            borrowInfo.collateral,
            principles,
            borrowInfo.isNFT,
            borrowInfo.receiptID,
            borrowInfo.isNFT ? 1 : amountOfCollateral,
            borrowInfo.valuableAssetAmount,
            amountOfCollateral,
            borrowInfo.valuableAsset,
@>          borrowInfo.duration,
            amountPerPrinciple,
            borrowID, //borrowInfo.id,
            offers,
            s_OwnershipContract,
            feeInterestLender,
            feeAddress
        );
        ...... SKIP ......
    }
```
- The [DBOImplementation.acceptBorrowOffer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L137-L183) function transfers collaterals from the contract to the borrower when the residual collateral is less than 10 percent and not zero.
```solidity
    function acceptBorrowOffer(
        uint amount
    ) public onlyAggregator nonReentrant onlyAfterTimeOut {
        ...... SKIP ......
        uint percentageOfAvailableCollateral = (borrowInformation
            .availableAmount * 10000) / m_borrowInformation.startAmount;

        // if available amount is less than 0.1% of the start amount, the order is no longer active and will count as completed.
        if (percentageOfAvailableCollateral <= 10) {
            isActive = false;
            // transfer remaining collateral back to owner
            if (borrowInformation.availableAmount != 0) {
@>              SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
                    IERC20(m_borrowInformation.collateral),
                    m_borrowInformation.owner,
                    borrowInformation.availableAmount
                );
            }
            borrowInformation.availableAmount = 0;
            IDBOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
            IDBOFactory(factoryContract).deleteBorrowOrder(address(this));
        } else {
            IDBOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
        }
    }
```
- As per readme, "any ERC20 that follows exactly the standard" can be used as collateral for borrow offers. However, if an ERC-777 token is used as collateral, the borrower's callback function will be triggered when the collaterals are transferred. At this point, the callback function can call the `DBOImplementation.updateBorrowOrder()` function.
- The [DBOImplementation.updateBorrowOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol#L232-L253) function does not have a `nonReentrant` modifier.
```solidity
    function updateBorrowOrder(
        uint newMaxApr,
        uint newDuration,
        uint[] memory newLTVs,
        uint[] memory newRatios
    ) public onlyOwner {
        ...... SKIP ......
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A borrower creates a borrow offer with an ERC-777 token as collateral.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The `updateBorrowOrder()` function can modify several parameters of the borrow offer, including APR, LTV, and duration. Here’s a simplified scenario focusing on the duration:
1. The borrower creates a borrow offer using an ERC-777 token as collateral, with a duration of `10 days`.
2. The borrower matches their own borrow offer with lend offers by calling `DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3()`, where the lend offers have a duration range of `5 to 20 days`.
3. The `matchOffersV3()` function verifies that the borrow offer's duration falls within the lend offers' duration range.
4. The `matchOffersV3()` function calls `DBOImplementation.acceptBorrowOffer()`.
5. The `DBOImplementation.acceptBorrowOffer()` function transfers the collateral to the borrower.
6. Since the collateral is an ERC-777 token, the borrower’s callback function is invoked.
7. The borrower’s callback function calls `DBOImplementation.updateBorrowOrder()`, changing the duration to `30 days`.
8. As a result, the borrower is able to borrow funds for `30 days`, exceeding the maximum duration of `20 days` set by the lend offers.

### Impact

The borrower can manipulate key parameters, such as duration, APR, LTV, and ratios, to favorable borrowing terms that exceed the conditions agreed upon in the lending offers.

### PoC

6. Since the collateral is an ERC-777 token, the borrower’s callback function is invoked.

8. As a result, the borrower is able to borrow funds for `30 days`, exceeding the maximum duration of `20 days` set by the lend offers.

### Mitigation

Add the `nonReentrant` modifier to the `DBOImplementation.updateBorrowOrder()` function as follows.
```diff
    function updateBorrowOrder(
        uint newMaxApr,
        uint newDuration,
        uint[] memory newLTVs,
        uint[] memory newRatios
--  ) public onlyOwner {
++  ) public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
        ...... SKIP ......
    }
```
