# LTV of 100% would be extremely dangerous.

### Summary

Having an LTV of 100% that the lenders or borrowers can set is really dangerous as it doesn't take into account that oracle prices have the so called deviation, which can be anywhere from 0.25% to 2%. Meaning that the actual LTV would be `LTV + oracle1 deviation + oracle2 deviation`, which can result in `> 100% LTV`.


### Root Cause

The lender offer having 100% ltv or the borrower offer having 100% can be match, 

### Internal pre-conditions

Example oracles:
[[stETH : ETH](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/steth-eth)] - 0.5% deviation
[[DAI : ETH](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/dai-eth)] - 1% deviation
[[USDC : ETH](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/usdc-eth)] - 1% deviation
[[USDT : ETH](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/usdt-eth)]  - 1% deviation

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The matched lend/borrow offer having 100% will loss funds.

### Impact

LTV of 100% or even above would result in lenders/borrower losing their funds.

### Mitigation

Have a lower max LTV.
