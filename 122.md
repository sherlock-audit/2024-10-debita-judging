# Incorrect Collateral and Principle pricing due to a check in `getPriceFrom()`

## Summary
The ``DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3`` function is used to retrieve prices for collateral and principles using the oracle specified.
When ``DebitaChainlink.sol`` becomes the specified oracle, it is important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down while utilizing Chainlink in chains like Arbitrum. ``getPriceFrom`` doesn't check If Arbitrum sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds.
This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.
## Vulnerability Details
There is no check:
getPriceFrom
```javascript
  function getPriceFrom(
        address _oracle,
        address _token
    ) internal view returns (uint) {
        require(oracleEnabled[_oracle], "Oracle not enabled");
        return IOracle(_oracle).getThePrice(_token);
    }
```
## Impact
- Mispricing of principles (the assets being borrowed) could affect the loan-to-value (LTV) ratios.
```javascript
uint pricePrinciple = getPriceFrom(lendInfo.oracle_Principle, principles[principleIndex]);
```

```javascript
uint pricePrinciple = getPriceFrom(lendInfo.oracle_Principle, principles[principleIndex]);
```
- Incorrect collateral prices could lead to misvaluation of the collateral's worth and if collateral prices are artificially inflated, -  borrowers might be able to borrow more than they should against their collateral.
```javascript
uint priceCollateral_BorrowOrder = getPriceFrom(borrowInfo.oracle_Collateral, borrowInfo.valuableAsset);
```
```javascript
uint priceCollateral_LendOrder = getPriceFrom(lendInfo.oracle_Collaterals[collateralIndex], borrowInfo.valuableAsset);
```
