# Reentrancy Vulnerability in claimBribes() Function in veNFTAerodrome.sol

### Summary

The claimBribes() function in the veNFTAerodrome.sol contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. Specifically, the function does not include proper reentrancy protection when transferring tokens to the sender after calling an external contract (voter.claimBribes()). This makes it possible for a malicious actor to exploit the function by re-entering the claimBribes() function during the token transfer, potentially draining tokens from the contract.

### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

In a reentrancy attack, an attacker could withdraw more tokens than intended, draining the balance of the contract. This is possible because the claimBribes() function calls the external voter.claimBribes() function before performing token transfers, which may allow an attacker to re-enter the contract during the token transfer process.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The simplest way to protect the claimBribes() function is to use a reentrancy guard modifier. The nonReentrant modifier from OpenZeppelinâ€™s ReentrancyGuard can be added to prevent reentrant calls.
