# Insufficient Sequencer Status Validation of Chainlink data feeds

### Summary

Missing validation for invalid rounds in sequencer uptime feed will cause incorrect price data acceptance as the protocol will consider sequencer to be up when round data is invalid. This is a special case in Arbitrum, since the protocol is going to be in Aribitrum this should be check.


### Root Cause

In DebitaChainlink.sol:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L49-L68
```solidity
function checkSequencer() public view returns (bool) {
    (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, , ) = sequencerUptimeFeed.latestRoundData();
    
    bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
    if (!isSequencerUp) {
        revert SequencerDown();
    }
    
    uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
    if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
        revert GracePeriodNotOver();
    }
}
```

The code lack the check for Arbitrum which the sequencer may not be initialized so the startedAt will return 0
As state in the [chainlinkDocs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#:~:text=The%20startedAt%20variable%20returns%200%20only%20on%20Arbitrum%20when%20the%20Sequencer%20Uptime%20contract%20is%20not%20yet%20initialized.)

If startedAt = 0, the timeSinceUp = block.timestamp so it will not revert in the case the sequencer isn't initialized on Arbitrum.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin set a L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds on Arbitrum that isn't initialized yet.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Accept prices during invalid sequencer status
Use stale or incorrect price data
Lead to unfair liquidations or incorrect loan ratios

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
function checkSequencer() public view returns (bool) {
    (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, , ) = sequencerUptimeFeed.latestRoundData();
    
    require(startedAt != 0, "Invalid round");  // Add check for invalid round
    
    bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
    if (!isSequencerUp) {
        revert SequencerDown();
    }
    
    uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
    if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
        revert GracePeriodNotOver();
    }
    
    return true;
}
```
