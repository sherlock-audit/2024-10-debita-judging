# getThePrice() in DebitaPyth may return the price with different decimals

### Summary

In Pyth, return price's decimal exists in price.expo. Different tokens may have different expo. We use this price directly in aggregator. This will cause the incorrect calculation.

### Root Cause

Pyth getPriceNoOlderThan() interface will return one token's price. In this return structure, the expo field stands for decimals. For example: -8 means 8 decimals, -10 means 10 decimals.
In [DebitaPyth:getThePrice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaPyth.sol#L25), we don't process the expo(decimal), return the price value directly. This will cause we may return unknown decimals price for one token. Currently, most tokens in Pyth is 8 decimals, but there are some tokens which decimals are not 8, eg, BONK, COQ, ELON, FLOKI, etc.
Compared with Chainlink oracle, chainlink oracle will keep return 8 decimals for feeds which is one pair with USD.
In matchOffersV3, we may get different tokens' price from different oracles. There oracles will be defined by the lend or borrow users. If one price is 8 decimal, another price is not 8 decimal, this will cause the incorrect calculations. This may cause dos or using the incorrect price to calculate the ratio.
```solidity
    struct Price {
        int64 price;
        uint64 conf;
        int32 expo;
        uint publishTime;
    }
```
```solidity
    function matchOffersV3(
        address[] memory lendOrders, // In one match offer, we can match several lend order for the same borrow order.
        uint[] memory lendAmountPerOrder, // lend amount for each lender order.
        uint[] memory porcentageOfRatioPerLendOrder,
        address borrowOrder, // borrow order.
        address[] memory principles, // principle we want to borrow from each lender.
        uint[] memory indexForPrinciple_BorrowOrder, // index of principle in the borrow order. THe borrower will mark the principle that he can accept.
        uint[] memory indexForCollateral_LendOrder, // index of collateral in the lend order. The lender will mark the collateral that he can accept
        uint[] memory indexPrinciple_LendOrder // 
    ) external nonReentrant returns (address) {
                uint priceCollateral_LendOrder = getPriceFrom(
                    lendInfo.oracle_Collaterals[collateralIndex],
                    borrowInfo.valuableAsset
                );
                // get the lender's principle's price based on lender's oracle.
                uint pricePrinciple = getPriceFrom(
                    lendInfo.oracle_Principle,
                    principles[principleIndex]
                );
}
```

### Mitigation

Normalize Pyth's price. Keep all prices from all oracles with the same decimal.
