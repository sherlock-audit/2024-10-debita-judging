# The NFR manager was not changed during the NFR ownership transfer, potentially causing the new owner to not able to claim his rewards or bribes.

### Vulnerability detail

NFR or Non-fungible receipt is a 1:1 representation of veNFTs and this NFR can be used as collateral when borrower takes a loan in Debitda protocol. Aside from this, all associated benefits of veNFTs will still remain such as voting power, rewards claiming, and lock extensions. These interactions are being handled by manager of NFR which can be either owner or chosen individual by the owner. 

However, there is an issue regarding the event of "transfer of ownership of NFR". Remember that this NFR can be collateral for a loan and in case of default, this will be auctioned to the winning buyer. Once the winning buyer already possessed the NFR, he will be the owner and expected to control the interaction of that NFR inside the Debitda protocol, but that is not the case, because when the NFR has been transferred to the new owner, the manager has not been changed or updated automatically.  The new owner still need to manually update it by executing [changeManager](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/veNFTAerodrome.sol#L110-L123) function. This situation can be problematic because the malicious manager can abuse this vulnerability.

If the manager has not been updated automatically during the transfer, this could bring window of opportunity for malicious action by the current manager. One critical action that he can do is to [claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/Receipt-veNFT.sol#L128-L142) the rewards or bribes via frontunning before the new owner able to change the manager. The rewards claiming should be done by the new owner, but in this case not able to do, because the malicious manager already claimed the rewards.

The situation can be even more critical if the newly acquired NFR is used quickly as collateral for the loan by new owner. Once the NFR collateral is transferred to the loan contract. The new owner can't do anything to prevent the malicious manager from interacting with the NFR's veNFTs specially the claiming of rewards or bribes. The detail of scenario can be seen in the attack path for reference.


### Root Cause

The manager of the NFR has not been updated automatically during the transfer of ownership once the new buyer win the auction. This can cause issues specially in claiming rewards. The malicious manager can take advantage of the situation and claim all rewards via frontrunning before the new owner able to change the manager.

Below is the proof from the code in which there is no update in NFR manager during transfer. This is the buy function in which the actual transfer of NFR to the new buyer is happening.

### Internal pre-conditions
There are no pre-conditions as this can happen in every liquidation auction NFR transfer.

### External pre-conditions
There are no pre-conditions as this can happen in every liquidation auction NFR transfer.

### Attack Path
Here is the scenario:
1. Borrower defaults from his loan.
2. The borrower's NFR collateral has been auctioned to find the new buyer or owner.
3. Auction completed and the collateral NFR has been transferred to the new buyer.
4. The new buyer used the newly acquired NFR to become collateral for his new borrow order.
5. The borrow order has been matched to lend offers and created loan contract.
6. The NFR will be transferred from new buyer to the loan contract.
7. During this time, veNFTs in relation with the NFR, has accumulated rewards ready to be claimed.
8. Since the manager has not been changed during the NFR transfer, the current manager who is assigned by the previous owner take advantage of situation and able to claim all bribes/rewards from the veNFTs.
9. The new buyer can't do anything to prevent this from happening as his NFR is already in the loan contract.
10. The new buyer lost his bribes/rewards. 


### Impact

Lost of rewards or bribes for the new owner of the NFR.

### PoC

see attack path for step details

### Mitigation

In every auction process, the transfer of the auctioned nft should automatically update the NFR manager to avoid malicious action from the current manager assigned by previous owner.
