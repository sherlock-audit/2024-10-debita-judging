# The owner of the offer may withdraw more interests than he should

### Summary

The [`_claimDebt`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L288) function allows a lender to claim the full repayment of a loan if it is fully paid and the interests if there are available. But because of incorrect assignment the `interestToClaim` is never reset to 0.

### Root Cause

In [`DebitaV3Loan.sol::302`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L301C35-L302C7) `0` is assigned to `memory` value insted of the actual `storage`:

```solidity
    function _claimDebt(uint index) internal {
       infoOfOffers memory offer = m_loan._acceptedOffers[index];
        ...
        uint interest = offer.interestToClaim;
@>      offer.interestToClaim = 0; //@audit changing the memory variable, not the storage variable

        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(offer.principle),
            msg.sender,
            interest + offer.principleAmount
        );
    }
```
