# Fee-on-Transfer Tokens Don't Work on TaxTokensReceipt

### Summary

TaxTokensReceipt is supposed to work with fee-on-transfer tokens, but transactions will revert if they're used. Even though balance is taken before and after, the function then requires that the full amount it requested to transferFrom was transferred. With any fee-on-transfer token this will fail.
