# BorrowOrder can't be created for NFT with `tokenID = 0` due to strict check in `createBorrowOrder()`

### Summary

 BorrowOrder can't be created for NFT with `tokenID = 0` due to strict check in `createBorrowOrder()`

### Root Cause

In [createBorrowOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L90), there is a require statement which checks tokenID/_receiptID not to be 0(zero) 
```solidity
function createBorrowOrder(
        bool[] memory _oraclesActivated,
        uint[] memory _LTVs,
        uint _maxInterestRate,
        uint _duration,
        address[] memory _acceptedPrinciples,
        address _collateral,
        bool _isNFT,
        uint _receiptID,
        address[] memory _oracleIDS_Principles,
        uint[] memory _ratio,
        address _oracleID_Collateral,
        uint _collateralAmount
    ) external returns (address) {
        if (_isNFT) {
@>          require(_receiptID != 0, "Receipt ID cannot be 0");
            require(_collateralAmount == 1, "Started Borrow Amount must be 1");
        }
```
The problem is, a lot of NFTs starts with tokenID = 0, and above check will not allow any NFT with tokenID = 0 to be used as collateral. It only allows NFTs tokenID > 0 as collateral.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

NFT should start from tokenID = 0

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

NFTs with tokenID = 0 can not be used as collateral


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the above check because if NFT starts with tokenID = 0 then it will pass & if not then it will revert while transferring
