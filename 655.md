### Internal pre-conditions

The attacker needs to make at least 1 loan.
- The attacker's address must be in mapping `isBorrowOrderLegit `

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L56-L59

The value true is assigned in function `createBorrowOrder `
```solidity
function createBorrowOrder(){
  ...
  isBorrowOrderLegit[address(borrowOffer)] = true;
  ...
}
```

### External pre-conditions
