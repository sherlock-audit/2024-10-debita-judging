# Borrow orders are not deployed through proxies

### Summary

Orders and loans should be proxies pointing to their respective implementation. However, this is not the case in `DBOFactory::createBorrowOrder()`.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol:106`, during borrow order creation, they are not deployed using proxies, as lend orders are when [created](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L151-L157).

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A borrower calls `DBOFactory::createBorrowOrder()` to create a borrow order, but a proxy is not deployed.

### Impact

This can have several implications, depending on the design. 
One of these is that if borrow orders are not deployed using proxies, it may limit the ability to upgrade the contract logic related to borrow orders without redeploying the entire system or affecting existing orders.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider deploying borrow orders as proxies pointing to their respective implementation.
