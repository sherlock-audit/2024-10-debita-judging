# Attacker can perform unauthorized NFT burn due to missing validation in burn function

### Summary

The burn() function does not validate the existence or ownership of the provided tokenId. This allows unauthorized destruction of NFTs, leading to asset loss, denial of service, or exploitation by malicious or compromised loan contracts. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol#L49

### Root Cause

The burn() function lacks essential checks for:
Ownership or Authorization: The function does not confirm whether the caller owns the token or has explicit permission to burn it.
Token Existence: No _exists(tokenId) check is performed.

These validations are critical to enforce ERC-721 token ownership principles.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The burn() function is callable by any contract recognized as a loan contract via isSenderALoan.
2. _burn(tokenId) is executed without validating tokenId.
3. The loan contract does not enforce explicit authorization mechanisms for burning tokens.

### External pre-conditions

- A malicious or compromised loan contract must exist.
- An NFT contract with this vulnerable burn() implementation is deployed.
- An attacker must control or influence the loan contract recognized by the system.

### Attack Path

- An attacker creates or compromises a loan contract.
- The loan contract calls the burn() function, passing an arbitrary tokenId.
- The absence of tokenId validation allows the attacker to:
- Burn NFTs they do not own.
- Destroy critical tokens, disrupting the platformâ€™s functionality.

### Impact

The impacts can be: 
- Unauthorized Asset Destruction: NFTs owned by legitimate users can be burned. Leads to irreversible financial loss.

- Denial of Service (DoS): Critical tokens required for operational purposes may be destroyed.

- Reputation Damage: Users lose trust in the platform due to unprotected asset handling.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Some validations can be added such as: 
require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, "Caller does not own the token.");    

Alternatively, token burns can be restricted to explicitly authorized loan contracts or entities.
