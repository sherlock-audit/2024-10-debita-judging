# updateLendOrder() Vulnerable to Front-running Attacks Leading to Malicious Loan Term Manipulation

### Summary
The `DebitaLendOffer-Implementation::updateLendOrder()` function in DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol can be front-run by the order owner to maliciously manipulate loan terms (APR, LTV, duration) just before a borrower's acceptance transaction, potentially forcing unfavorable terms on borrowers.

### Root Cause
The order owner has the ability to update loan terms at any time while the offer is active, without any timelock or cooldown period. This creates a race condition where owners can see pending borrower transactions and front-run them with parameter changes.

### Internal pre-conditions
- Lending offer must be active (`isActive == true`)
- Caller must be the owner of the lending offer
- New parameters must match existing array lengths

### External pre-conditions
- Pending borrower transaction to accept the lending offer
- Mempool visibility to see pending transactions
- Sufficient gas to front-run transactions

### Attack Path
1. Borrower submits transaction to accept lending offer with original terms
2. Owner monitors mempool for pending accept transactions
3. Owner front-runs with `updateLendOrder()` to change terms (e.g., higher APR)
4. Borrower's transaction executes with modified, unfavorable terms
5. Owner optionally back-runs to restore original terms

### Impact
- Borrowers forced into worse loan terms than intended
- Possible forced liquidations through duration manipulation
- Loss of user funds through higher APR or lower LTV ratios
- Platform reputation damage and loss of trust
- Unfair advantage to malicious lenders


### Mitigation
```diff
function updateLendOrder(
        uint newApr,
        uint newMaxDuration,
        uint newMinDuration,
        uint[] memory newLTVs,
        uint[] memory newRatios
    ) public onlyOwner {
        require(isActive, "Offer is not active");
+        require(block.timestamp>=lastParameterUpdateTime+PARAMETER_UPDATE_TIMELOCK,"Parameters are timelocked");
        
        // ... existing parameter updates ...
        
        lastParameterUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        emit ParametersUpdated(newApr, newMaxDuration, newLTVs, newRatios);
    }
}
```
