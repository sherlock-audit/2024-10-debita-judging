# Precision loss in while calculating the fee in `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3`.

### Summary



In the function `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3`, the percentage fee is calculated as:  
[[Line 391](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L391)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L391).  

And later, this fee is fit between the maximum and the minimum fee:  
[[Lines 525-531](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L525-L531)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L525-L531).  

The precision loss in the calculation of the fee can lead to losses of thousands of dollars for the protocol.  

### Scenario Example:  
Let's take a scenario where a user wants to borrow $500k in USDT for 1,727,999 seconds (1 second less than 20 days):  
- **Percentage Fee Calculation:**  
  Percentage = (1727999 * 4) / 86400 = 79.9999 = 79 (Rounded)  

- **Impact:**  
  This means the user saved 0.01% (0.01 * 500k = $5,000) fee just by decreasing the borrow duration by 1 second.  



### Root Cause

Precision loss while calculating the percentage for the fee

### Internal pre-conditions

NA

### External pre-conditions

1. User should borrow for less than 20 days.

### Attack Path

1. Borrower creates a new borrow order using the function `DBOFactory::createBorrowOrder`, with some `borrowInfo.duration` which can lead to high precision loss.
2. Aggregator matches his borrow order with some lender order by calling the function `DBOFactory::createBorrowOrder()`.

### Impact


Precision loss in fee calculation allows users to manipulate borrow durations to avoid paying a portion of fees, potentially resulting in significant revenue losses and undermining the protocol's financial sustainability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use some higher precision.
