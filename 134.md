# Missing Stale Price Checks in Chainlink Price Feed Integration

### Summary

The absence of stale price checks in the `DebitaChainlink::getThePrice()` function could lead to the use of incorrect or outdated price data, compromising the protocol's security. The `latestRoundData() `function of Chainlink does not verify if the returned data is stale or incomplete, leaving the protocol vulnerable to inaccurate price feeds.



### Root Cause

In DebitaChainlink.sol, the getThePrice function retrieves price data using Chainlink's latestRoundData() without verifying the returned data's freshness or validity.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol could use stale or invalid prices in calculations, potentially leading to incorrect settlements, inaccurate valuations, or exploitation of price manipulation by attackers. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement checks to validate the price data's freshness and completeness before use. For example:
```solidity

(uint80 roundID, int256 price, , uint256 updateTime, uint80 answeredInRound) = 
    priceFeed.latestRoundData();

require(updateTime != 0, "Round not complete");
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale Price");
require(price > 0, "Invalid Price");
```
By verifying the updatedAt, answeredInRound, and price values, the protocol ensures that the price data is current and accurate.
