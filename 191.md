# Owner will permanently retain initialization rights due to UNSET INITIALIZATION FLAG.

### Summary

An unset initialization flag(` bool private initialized`) https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol#L18C4-L18C30 in `DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol` will cause a permanent security bypass for all users as owner will retain the ability to repeatedly call initialization-phase functions that should be one-time-only.

### Root Cause

in `DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol` 
```solidity
bool private initialized;  // Never set to true anywhere in the contract

modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == admin && !initialized);
    _;
}

function setDebitaContract(address newContract) public onlyOwner {
    DebitaContract = newContract;
}

function transferOwnership(address _newAddress) public onlyOwner {
    admin = _newAddress;
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `initialized` needs to remain false (default state)
- No function exists to set it to true
- Variable is declared but never modified: bool private initialized;
2. `msg.sender` needs to be equal to ` admin` address
 - Admin address is set in constructor: admin = msg.sender;
 - Admin hasn't transferred ownership to another address

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.  Owner repeatedly calls `setDebitaContract()` or  other admin functions
   Since the `initialized `flag is` never` set to true, the admin can continue to change critical parameters of the contract at will, leading to potential exploitation of the contract's functionality.


### Impact

- The affected party suffers an approximate loss of control over critical contract functions. The owner retains the ability to execute initialization-phase functions indefinitely, leading to potential misuse of contract privileges.

- In this scenario, the attacker (admin) gains unrestricted access to modify contract parameters and ownership without any checks, which could result in significant financial losses for users and stakeholders if the admin decides to act maliciously.
