# Improper Handling of Fee-on-Transfer Tokens in the deposit Function in `TaxTokenReceipt.sol`

## Summary
The `deposit` function does not correctly handle fee-on-transfer tokens. The function compares the expected transferred amount (`amount`) with the actual difference in the contractâ€™s balance (`difference`). This strict comparison (`require(difference >= amount)`) causes the function to revert when dealing with tokens that impose a transfer fee, as the actual tokens received (`difference`) will always be less than the `amount` specified by the sender due to the fee deduction.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the relevant portion of the [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L59-L75) function:
```js
function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
    uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
    SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
        ERC20(tokenAddress),
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        amount
    );
    uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
    require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed"); // @audit
    tokenID++;
    tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
    _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
    emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
    return tokenID;
}
```

`Fee-on-transfer` tokens deduct a percentage of the tokens during every transfer. For example, if the user specifies an amount of 100 tokens to deposit and the token has a 2% transfer fee, the actual tokens received by the contract (`difference`) will only be 98 tokens.

The strict comparison in the require statement:
```js
require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
```
requires the contract to receive at least the full amount. This condition will fail for fee-on-transfer tokens, causing the function to revert even though the transfer was otherwise successful.

Additionally, the function records the user-provided amount instead of the actual received amount (difference), which may create further inconsistencies if the value is used later.

## Impact
Incompatibility with Fee-on-Transfer Tokens: Users cannot deposit tokens that charge a fee on transfer, making the contract unusable for such tokens.

## Tools
Manual Review

## Recommendation
**Changed require Condition:** The condition `difference > 0` ensures that the function does not revert for fee-on-transfer tokens and only checks that some tokens were received.
