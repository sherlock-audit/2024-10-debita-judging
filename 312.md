# Unsafe Usage of ERC20 `transfer` and `transferFrom` in `DebitaIncentives` Contract

## Summary
The `DebitaIncentives` contract assumes that all ERC20 tokens conform to the standard of returning a boolean (bool) value for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. However, tokens like USDT deviate from this standard. This causes two key functions, `claimIncentives` and `incentivizePair`, to behave incorrectly. Transfers may fail silently, allowing operations to appear successful even if tokens are not transferred.
## Vulnerability Details
**claimIncentives:**
This function attempts to transfer tokens to users. If the token does not return a boolean, the function may succeed but fail to transfer the tokens. Users will not receive their incentives, but the transaction will appear successful.
**incentivizePair:**
This function attempts to transfer tokens to the contract. If the token does not return a boolean, the function may fail to transfer the tokens without reverting, leaving the contract without the intended funds.

## Impact
The `claimIncentives` function might indicate successful transfers even if the transfer did not occur, resulting in incorrect behavior.
The `incentivizePair` function might appear to succeed while the tokens are not transferred to the contract, leading to incorrect accounting and potential financial discrepancies.
## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20 library to handle token transfers. This library ensures compatibility with non-standard tokens like USDT by properly verifying the success of transfer and transferFrom operations.
