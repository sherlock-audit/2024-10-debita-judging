# Lenders receive interest twice in claimDebt()

### Summary

Lenders receive interest twice in claimDebt() because interestToClaim is set 0 in memory

### Root Cause

Lender can claim their debt using [claimDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L271), which sends the principalAmount + interestAmount. The issue is, it sends the interestAmount twice to the lender
```solidity
   function _claimDebt(uint256 index) internal {
...
        loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
        ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID);
        uint256 interest = offer.interestToClaim;
@>      offer.interestToClaim = 0;

@>      SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(offer.principle), msg.sender, interest + offer.principleAmount);

        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));
    }
```
In the above code ie [_claimDebt()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L302) we can see, it sends the principalAmount + interest to lender and sets the interestToClaim = 0 in memory. Lets see the [claimInterest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L262C8-L267C79), it also sends the interestToClaim to lender.
```solidity
    function claimInterest(uint256 index) internal {
        IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);
        infoOfOffers memory offer = loanData._acceptedOffers[index];
@>      uint256 interest = offer.interestToClaim;

        require(interest > 0, "No interest to claim");

        loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim = 0;
@>      SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(offer.principle), msg.sender, interest);
        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Lender should not be perpetual

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Suppose borrowed paid the debt to a lender which is not perpetual
2. Lender tried to claim his principal + interest using claimDebt() and receives the interest twice

### Impact

Lender will receive interest twice, which is a loss for borrower

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set the interestToClaim = 0 in storage in _claimDebt()
```diff
    function _claimDebt(uint256 index) internal {
...
+       loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim = 0;
-       offer.interestToClaim = 0;
...
    }
```
