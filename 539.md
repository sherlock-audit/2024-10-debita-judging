### Attack Path

When `_claimDebt` function is executed, `ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID)` will be executed to burn the lender offer NFT, as shown in Line 300 below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L300

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Loan.sol
288:     function _claimDebt(uint index) internal {
289:         LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
290:         IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract); //
291: 
292:         infoOfOffers memory offer = m_loan._acceptedOffers[index];
293:         require(
294:             ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) == msg.sender,
295:             "Not lender"
296:         );
297:         require(offer.paid == true, "Not paid");
298:         require(offer.debtClaimed == false, "Already claimed");
299:         loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
300:         ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID);
```

However, when the debt of the lend offer is repaid and automatically added to the perpetual lender order, the lend offer NFT is not burned.

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Loan.sol
186:     function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
..SNIP..
232:             // if the lender is the owner of the offer and the offer is perpetual, then add the funds to the offer
233:             if (lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer) {
234:                 loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
235:                 IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);
236:                 lendOffer.addFunds(total);
237:             } else {
238:                 loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim =
239:                     interest -
240:                     feeOnInterest;
241:             }
```

### Impact

Lender Offer NFT is not burned after the debt is claimed. As a result, the Lender Offer NFT could still continue be used within Debita protocol or be sold to someone else.

### Mitigation

```diff
// if the lender is the owner of the offer and the offer is perpetual, then add the funds to the offer
if (lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer) {
    loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
+		ownershipContract.burn(loanData._acceptedOffers[index].lenderID);    
    IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);
    lendOffer.addFunds(total);
} else {
    loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim =
        interest -
        feeOnInterest;
}
```
