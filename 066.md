# The latest loan always missing in getAllLoans return data.

### Summary

The `getAllLoans` function in the `DebitaV3Aggregator` contract always omits the latest loan in its returned array, regardless of the `offset` and `limit` values provided. This results in incomplete data and unreliable results when querying all loans.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/tree/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L693-L719

- In DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:708, there is conditional error.

```solidity
if ((i + offset + 1) >= loanID) {  
    break;  
}  
```

This condition prematurely terminates the loop when the index `i + offset + 1` equals `loanID`


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- The latest loan data is always missing from the returned loans array, causing incomplete data retrieval for users or external systems.
- This bug affects data integrity, making the function unreliable for querying the full set of loans.
- Depending on the application logic, this may lead to financial misrepresentation or operational errors when using this function's output.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the conditional logic to allow the loop to iterate through `loanID` inclusively.
Replace:
```diff
- if ((i + offset + 1) >= loanID) {  
+if ((i + offset) >= loanID) {  
    break;  
}  
```
