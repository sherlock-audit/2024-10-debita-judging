# Factory Owner Can not change Aggregator address if once wrongly set( can be an EOA address)

### Summary

In `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol` and in `DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol`  function `setAggregatorContract()` does not have option to change the address of Aggregator if it is wrongly set at first. Moreover It does not check if it is a contract or not while setting Aggregator address.

### Root Cause

In [`DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol:L201-205`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L201-L205) and in [`DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol:L245-249`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L245-L249) 
```solidity
function setAggregatorContract(address _aggregatorContract) external {
        require(aggregatorContract == address(0), "Already set");
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set aggregator contract");
        aggregatorContract = _aggregatorContract;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. If the the Owner of the Factory set the address of the Aggregator wrongly at first, may be an EOA address. 

### External pre-conditions

1. If the Owner try to change the Aggregator address, then the call will revert.
```solidity
require(aggregatorContract == address(0), "Already set");
```

### Attack Path

1. First a wrong address (EOA address) is set for Aggregator
2. Then if the owner try to change the Aggregator it would revert

### Impact

 As a whole the protocol would be useless after deployment. A fresh deployment of both Factory contracts would be necessary which would cost some unnecessary gas fee.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If Owner can reset the address of Aggregator at any time, Then this would introduce centralization risk. So there should be an additional check while setting Aggregator address that this address can not be an EOA address.
```solidity
function setAggregatorContract(address _aggregatorContract) external {
        require(
            aggregatorContract == address(0) &&
             +++++   _aggregatorContract.code.length > 0,
            "Already set"
        );
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can set aggregator contract");
        aggregatorContract = _aggregatorContract;
    }
```
