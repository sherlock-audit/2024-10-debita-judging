### Attack Path

The `feeAmount` at Line 120 below might round down to zero if the `amount` or `sellFee()` is low.

Some tokens will revert when attempts are made to transfer with a zero value. In this case, some sellers will not be able to sell their veAERO NFT to the buyer via the buy order.

```solidity
File: buyOrder.sol
92:     function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
..SNIP..
118:         buyInformation.availableAmount -= amount;
119:         buyInformation.capturedAmount += collateralAmount;
120:         uint feeAmount = (amount *
121:             IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).sellFee()) / 10000;
122:         SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
123:             IERC20(buyInformation.buyToken),
124:             msg.sender,
125:             amount - feeAmount
126:         );
127: 
128:         SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
129:             IERC20(buyInformation.buyToken),
130:             IBuyOrderFactory(buyOrderFactory).feeAddress(),
131:             feeAmount
132:         );
```

Another part of the code has a similar root cause (transfer with zero value) and should be marked as a duplicate of this issue.

Following are a few more instances of similar issues:

**Instance 2 - Auction**

In this case, the auction will not work, which might lead to veAERO NFT to be stuck within the auction contract, and lender will not be repaid

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L136

```solidity
File: Auction.sol
109:     function buyNFT() public onlyActiveAuction {
..SNIP..
123:         // calculate fee
124:         uint feeAmount = (currentPrice * fee) / 10000;
125:         // get fee address
126:         address feeAddress = auctionFactory(factory).feeAddress();
127:         // Transfer liquidation token from the buyer to the owner of the auction
..SNIP..
135:         SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
136:             IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
137:             msg.sender,
138:             feeAddress,
139:             feeAmount
140:         );
```

**Instance 3 - Aggregator**

In this case, the matching order will fail due to revert.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L554

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Aggregator.sol
274:     function matchOffersV3(
..SNIP..
544:             uint feeToPay = (amountPerPrinciple[i] * percentage) / 10000;
545:             uint feeToConnector = (feeToPay * feeCONNECTOR) / 10000;
546:             feePerPrinciple[i] = feeToPay;
547:             // transfer fee to feeAddress
548:             SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
549:                 IERC20(principles[i]),
550:                 feeAddress,
551:                 feeToPay - feeToConnector
552:             );
553:             // transfer fee to connector
554:             SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
555:                 IERC20(principles[i]),
556:                 msg.sender,
557:                 feeToConnector
558:             );
```

### Impact

The following are the negative impacts:

- Core contract functionalities are broken
- veAERO NFT to be stuck within the auction contract, and lender will not be repaid
- Matching order does not work. Loss of fee for the protocol as the protocol charges a fee against the total amount being matched.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Always check that `feeAmount` is larger than zero before transferring.
