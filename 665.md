# Chainlink oracle does not account for aggregator decimals making it unusable

### Summary

the debita chainlink oracle returns the EXACT price returned by  the chainlink aggregator
the issue here is that chainlink doesnt always return price in the same decimals ie it returns price feeds with eth in 18 decimals whilst it returns other prices in 8 decimals 

this means that in order for eth/weth to be supported as either principle or collateral, it would, the difference in oracle decimals would cause wrong calculation of collateral 

for effective function of the aggregator must mean that all tokens must have the same base token ie if using usd 
then all tokens must be in terms of usd ie eth/usd or wbtc/usd, of if using eth then wbtc/eth 

meaning for eth be used, without breaking logic, then it must be the base token of every oracle so as to make every price return back with 18 decimals , and while chainlink does pair every token with eth, because chainlink is one directional (ie there is only eth/dai and no dai/eth) this is not possible making eth a very bad base token 

a base token like usd is much more viable  based on the logic of the aggregator since it is a stable coin as serves as a base of almost all other tokens  but that also means that the eth/usd oracle would end up returning 18 decimals against the 8 that wbtc/usd would return 
### Root Cause

oracle decimals are not normalized 

### Internal pre-conditions

whitelisting of oracles that return different decimals 

### External pre-conditions

an order that interacts with weth as either the collateral or the principle 

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

weth is not supported without allowing 

excess  collateral is weth is the principle token 

less collateral or weth is the collateral or the call may revert 

### PoC

same oracle set for both lender and borrower which is the chainlink oracle supported by the protocol 
oracle prices returned by chainlink wbtc = 800_000_000_000
oracle prices returned by chainlink eth = 4_000_000_000_000_000_000_000

assume same ltv for simplicity ie 0.95 
same oracle so same ratio for borrower and lender is same

case 1 
assume a wbtc price of 80_000 usd principle 
and weth price of 4000 usd collateral 

the ratio here would be 4_000_000_000_000_000_000_000 * 1e8(wbtc decimals)/ 800_000_000_000 * 9500 / 10000
= 4.7499999999999994e+17 

a borrow amount of 1 unit ie 1e8 wbtc would then require 
= 1e8 * 1e18 / 4.7499999999999994e+17  = 210526315 weth in collateral (few weis)
the actual required collateral should be something around 20e18 weth 

case 2
assume a wbtc price of 80_000 usd collateral 
and weth price of 4000 usd principle 

in this case the ratio is  an astounding zero which will cause the call to revert when calculating collateral due to division by zero
