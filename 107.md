# deleteBorrowOrder() set the borrowOrderIndex of _borrowOrder to 0(zero), which is wrong

### Summary

deleteBorrowOrder() set the borrowOrderIndex of _borrowOrder to 0(zero), which is wrong

### Root Cause

In [deleteBorrowOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L165)(), borrowOrderIndex of the _borrowOrder is set to 0(zero), which is wrong because in createBorrowOrder(), index starts from 0(zero) which means there is already a borrowOrder at index = 0. 

If we set the borrowOrderIndex of deleted borrowOrder to 0(zero), it will override the borrowOrder already present at index = 0.
```solidity
function deleteBorrowOrder(address _borrowOrder) external onlyBorrowOrder {
        // get index of the borrow order
        uint index = borrowOrderIndex[_borrowOrder];
@>      borrowOrderIndex[_borrowOrder] = 0;
...
    }
```

Same issue is present in auction, buyOrder, lendOrder

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

When a borrowOrder is fulfilled then it deletes the borrowOrder but will not be, instead it will override the borrowOrder present at index = 0

### Impact

borrowOrder at index = 0 will be overridden by other deleted borrowOrder


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Start the borrowOrderIndex/activeOrdersCount from 1, instead of starting from 0
```diff
function createBorrowOrder(
        bool[] memory _oraclesActivated,
        uint[] memory _LTVs,
        uint _maxInterestRate,
        uint _duration,
        address[] memory _acceptedPrinciples,
        address _collateral,
        bool _isNFT,
        uint _receiptID,
        address[] memory _oracleIDS_Principles,
        uint[] memory _ratio,
        address _oracleID_Collateral,
        uint _collateralAmount
    ) external returns (address) {
+      activeOrdersCount++;
...

        borrowOrderIndex[address(borrowOffer)] = activeOrdersCount;
        allActiveBorrowOrders[activeOrdersCount] = address(borrowOffer);
-       activeOrdersCount++;
...
    }
```
