# Owner of `DebitaV3Aggregator`, `AuctionFactory` and `buyOrderFactory` cannot be changed due to variable shadowing

### Summary

Every [changeOwner()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186-L190) function call to update the owner of `DebitaV3Aggregator`, `AuctionFactory` or `buyOrderFactory` will revert because the `owner` variable is shadowed, as it shares the same name as an already declared variable.

This prevents the current owner of the contract from changing the owner.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:682`, `AuctionFactory.sol:218` and `buyOrderFactory.sol:186`, the `address owner` parameter has already been declared.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Current owner of `DebitaV3Aggregator`, `AuctionFactory` or `buyOrderFactory` calls the respective `changeOwner()` function to change the owner within 6 hours of deployment.

### Impact

The owner of `DebitaV3Aggregator`, `AuctionFactory` and `buyOrderFactory` cannot be changed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

All of the `changeOwner()` function instances should be changed to the following:

```diff
+function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
     require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
     require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
+     owner = _owner;
}
```
