# The changeOwner() function will not change the contract owner

### Summary

in `AuctionFactory.sol` , `buyOrderFactory.sol` , `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol` :
The changeOwner function is intended to change the ownership of a contract. However, it does not update the state variable owner as expected. This issue occurs because the local parameter owner has the same name as the state variable owner. In Solidity, the local parameter takes precedence within the function scope, causing the statement owner = owner to assign the local owner to itself, without affecting the state variable.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:682](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682-L686) `owner = owner` does not changee the owner of contract: 
```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```
