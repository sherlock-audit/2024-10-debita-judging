# Some users cannot cancel auctions

### Summary

Users who are smart contracts and do not implement `OnERC721Received()` will not be able to call [Auction.cancelAuction()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L168-#L184) because of the ERC721 `safeTransferFrom()`.

They can create auctions just fine without `OnERC721Received` via `AuctionFactory.createAuction()`, but once created will not be able to cancel auctions.

Also, they get their initial NFT just fine through `_mint()`. As long as `safeMint()` is not used to initially give them their veNFT, then there is no `OnERC721Received` "check" until they try to cancel an auction.
