# Attacker can disproportionately claim incentives, reducing rewards for legitimate users

### Summary

The lack of time-weighted calculations in the incentive distribution will cause unfair over-allocation of incentives to attackers, as they can deposit large amounts just before an epoch ends to claim a significant share of rewards.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L142-L214

### Root Cause

In `DebitaIncentives.sol`, the `claimIncentives` function calculates incentives based solely on the total amount lent or borrowed during an epoch, without accounting for the duration of participation. This allows users to manipulate incentive distribution by contributing large amounts near the epoch's end.



### Internal pre-conditions

1. Attacker deposits a large amount: An attacker needs to deposit a significant amount of tokens into the lending protocol shortly before the epoch ends.
2. Incentive calculation based on total amounts: The contract uses the total lent or borrowed amounts during the epoch for incentive distribution without considering time-weighting.

### External pre-conditions

No time-weighting mechanism: The protocol lacks integration with any external time-weighting mechanisms for incentive calculations.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker waits until just before an epoch is about to end.
2. Attacker calls the lend function to deposit a large amount of tokens into the protocol.
3. Epoch ends, and incentives are calculated based on total amounts lent during the epoch.
4. Attacker's large late deposit skews the incentive distribution in their favor.
5. Attacker calls the claimIncentives function to claim a disproportionate share of incentives.
6. Legitimate users receive significantly fewer incentives than expected.

### Impact

Legitimate users suffer a reduction in expected incentive rewards due to the attacker's manipulation, receiving a smaller share of incentives despite their longer participation. The attacker gains an unfair portion of the incentives, undermining the protocol's reward system.

### PoC

```solidity
// Assume current epoch is about to end in a few blocks
uint currentEpoch = incentivesContract.currentEpoch();

// Step 1: Legitimate users have lent tokens throughout the epoch
// User A lent 100 tokens at epoch start
// User B lent 200 tokens at epoch start

// Step 2: Attacker lends 10,000 tokens just before epoch ends
lendingContract.lend(10000 ether);

// Step 3: Epoch ends, incentives are calculated
// Total lent amount: 10,300 tokens
// Attacker's share: (10,000 / 10,300) â‰ˆ 97%

// Step 4: Attacker claims incentives
address[] memory principles = new address[](1);
principles[0] = address(principleToken);

address[][] memory tokensIncentives = new address[][](1);
tokensIncentives[0] = new address[](1);
tokensIncentives[0][0] = address(incentiveToken);

incentivesContract.claimIncentives(principles, tokensIncentives, currentEpoch);

// Attacker receives 97% of the incentives for the epoch
```

### Mitigation

Implement time-weighted calculations for incentive distribution:

- Modify the incentive calculation to consider both the amount and the duration of participation within an epoch.
- Track the time-weighted lending amounts for each user.
- Adjust the getLenderIncentives function to use time-weighted amounts when calculating the incentives.
Alternatively, set a maximum cap on incentives per user per epoch to prevent any single participant from claiming an excessive share.


Time-weighted Incentive Calculation:
```solidity
// New mapping to track the time-weighted lent amount per user per epoch
mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => uint)) public timeWeightedLentAmountPerUserPerEpoch;

// Mapping to store the timestamp when the user lent the funds
mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => uint)) public lentTimestampPerUserPerEpoch;
...

function updateFunds(
    // ... existing parameters ...
) public returns (bool) {
    // ... existing logic ...

    // For each lender
    for (uint i = 0; i < lenders.length; i++) {
        uint principleHash = hashVariables(principle, _currentEpoch);

        // Record the time the funds were lent
        lentTimestampPerUserPerEpoch[lenders[i]][principleHash] = block.timestamp;

        // Update the lent amount
        lentAmountPerUserPerEpoch[lenders[i]][principleHash] += informationOffers[i].principleAmount;
    }

    // ... existing logic ...
}
...
```
Calculating Time-weighted Amount:
Modify getLenderIncentives to calculate the time-weighted lent amount.

```solidity
function getLenderIncentives(
    address lender,
    address principle,
    address incentiveToken,
    uint epoch
) public view returns (uint amountToSend) {
    uint principleHash = hashVariables(principle, epoch);
    uint totalTimeWeightedLentAmount = totalTimeWeightedTokenPerEpoch[principle][epoch];
    uint userTimeWeightedLentAmount = timeWeightedLentAmountPerUserPerEpoch[lender][principleHash];
    uint totalIncentive = incentivizedPerEpoch[principle][incentiveToken][epoch];
    amountToSend =
        (userTimeWeightedLentAmount * totalIncentive) /
        totalTimeWeightedLentAmount;
}

```
Calculating Time-weighted Amount Upon Epoch End:
At the end of the epoch, calculate the time-weighted amounts.
```solidity
function finalizeEpoch(uint epoch) public {
    // Only callable by owner or trusted party
    // For each user, calculate the time-weighted lent amount
    for (uint i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
        address lender = users[i];
        uint principleHash = hashVariables(principle, epoch);
        uint lentAmount = lentAmountPerUserPerEpoch[lender][principleHash];
        uint lentTimestamp = lentTimestampPerUserPerEpoch[lender][principleHash];

        // Calculate the duration the funds were lent
        uint lendingDuration = epochEndTime[epoch] - lentTimestamp;

        // Calculate the time-weighted amount
        uint timeWeightedAmount = lentAmount * lendingDuration;

        // Update the mappings
        timeWeightedLentAmountPerUserPerEpoch[lender][principleHash] = timeWeightedAmount;
        totalTimeWeightedTokenPerEpoch[principle][epoch] += timeWeightedAmount;
    }
}
```
