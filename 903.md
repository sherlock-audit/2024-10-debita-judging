# DebitaChainLink: No check for stale price feed resulted in outdated oracle prices

### Summary

The DebitaChainLink contract utilises chainlink price feeds to retrieve the price of assets. However, there is no check for staleness on the data returned from the chainlink price feed.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L42-L46

### Root Cause

The price of an asset is retrieved via `latestRoundData()`. However, there there is **no validation check** to  ensure that the protocol does not ingest stale or incorrect pricing data that could indicate a faulty feed.

### Internal pre-conditions

- borrower/ lender has created a borrow/lend offer, providing the DebitaChainlinkOracle contract address as part of the oraclePrinciples/oracleCollateral array

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

In `matchOffersV3()`, the price returned from oracles is used to calculate the ratio on both the borrow-side and lend-side. 
- If the collateral price is stale and actually lower than reported, the lenders will accept less collateral than they should
- If the principle token price is stale and actually higher, borrowers could borrow more than they should be allowed to

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include additional validation checks

```solidity
(uint80 roundId, int256 price, ,uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
require(updatedAt != 0, "Incomplete round");
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
```
