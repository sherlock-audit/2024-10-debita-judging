### Attack Path

Assume that Bob creates a borrow offer with 10000 AERO as collateral to borrow 10000 USDC at the price/ratio of 1 AERO:1 USDC for simplicity's sake.

Malicious aggregator (aggregator is a public role and anyone can match orders) can perform griefing attacks against Bob.

The malicious aggregator can create many individual loans OR many loans with many offers within it, OR a combination of both. Each loan and offer will be small or tiny and consist of Bob's borrow order. This can be done because the protocol does not enforce any restriction on the minimum size of the loan or offer.

As a result, Bob's borrow offer could be broken down into countless (e.g., thousands or millions) of loans and offers. As a result, Bob will not be able to keep track of all the loans and offers belonging to him and will have issues paying the debt or claiming collateral.

This issue is also relevant to the lenders, and the impact is even more serious as lenders have to perform more actions against loans and offers, such as claiming debt, claiming interest, claiming collateral, or auctioning off defaulted collateral etc.

In addition, it also requires lenders and borrowers to pay a significant amount of gas fees in order to carry out the actions mentioned previously.

As a result, this effectively allows malicious aggregators to grief lenders and borrowers.

### Impact

Malicious aggregators to grief lenders and borrowers.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Having a maximum number of offers (e.g., 100) within a single Loan is insufficient to guard against this attack because malicious aggregators can simply work around this restriction by creating more loans.

Thus, it is recommended to impose the minimum size for each loan and/or offer, so that malicious aggregators cannot create many small/tiny loans and offers to grief the users.
