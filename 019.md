# changeOwner function wont work

### Summary

The following [`changeOwner`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682) is intended to change the owner of the contract, but the `owner` variable is shadowed and it will not change.

### Root Cause

The passed parameter `owner` is the same as the storage variable `owner` this leads to shadowing.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The owners of the contracts `DebitaV3Aggregator`, `AuctionFactory` and `buyOrderFactory` won't change because of a broken function

### PoC

```solidity
    function testChangeOwner() public {
        address newAddress = makeAddr("newOwner");
        factory.changeOwner(newAddress);

        vm.prank(newAddress);
        factory.changeOwner(makeAddr("newOwner2"));
    }
```

Output:

```plain
Failing tests:
Encountered 1 failing test in test/local/auctions/AuctionFactory.t.sol:AuctionFactoryTest
[FAIL: revert: Only owner] testChangeOwner() (gas: 10494)
```

### Mitigation

Change the parameter passed to function to `_owner`.
