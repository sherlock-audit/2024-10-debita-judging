# Delete functions lacks mapping updates

### Summary

The [`_deleteAuctionOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L145) function aims to remove an auction order from the active orders list and update necessary mappings to reflect the deletion. However, there is an overlooked issue: the function does not update the `isAuction` mapping to reflect that the auction is no longer active.

The [`deleteBorrowOffer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L162) is also aims to remove an borrow order but does not update `isBorrowOrderLegit` mapping.

The [`deleteOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207) lacks updates on `isLendOrderLegit` mapping

### Root Cause

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Giving example for first case.

The `_deleteAuctionOrder` function does not reset `isAuction[_AuctionOrder]` to `false` upon deletion. This means that even after an auction order is deleted, `isAuction[_AuctionOrder]` will remain `true`, inaccurately marking the auction order as active in the system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Giving example for first case.

Add missing sets to the `_deleteAuctionOrder` function

```diff
    function _deleteAuctionOrder(address _AuctionOrder) external onlyAuctions {
        // get index of the Auction order
        uint index = AuctionOrderIndex[_AuctionOrder];
        AuctionOrderIndex[_AuctionOrder] = 0;

        // get last Auction order
        allActiveAuctionOrders[index] = allActiveAuctionOrders[
            activeOrdersCount - 1
        ];
        // take out last Auction order
        allActiveAuctionOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

        // switch index of the last Auction order to the deleted Auction order
        AuctionOrderIndex[allActiveAuctionOrders[index]] = index;
        activeOrdersCount--;
+       isAuction[_AuctionOrder] = false;
    }
```
