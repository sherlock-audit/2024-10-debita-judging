# Interest Rate Cap Issue in DBOFactory Smart Contract

### Summary

The logic for enforcing a maximum interest rate on borrow orders in the `DBOFactory` contract doesn't properly handle cases where utilization exceeds 100%, leading to the potential for interest rates to exceed the maximum allowable rate and cause reverts. This will prevent borrow orders from being created or processed, potentially locking user funds.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L75

- In the `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol` contract, the logic to enforce a maximum interest rate (`_maxInterestRate`) during borrow order creation does not account for situations where reserves exceed cash. As a result, when the utilization rate exceeds 100%, the calculated interest rate can exceed the maximum specified rate, causing the transaction to fail with a revert due to the check on the interest rate exceeding the max allowable rate.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `reserves` in the protocol are greater than the available cash, causing the utilization rate to exceed 100%.
2. The user creates a borrow order with a specified `_maxInterestRate` that is higher than the calculated interest rate.
3. The contract attempts to calculate the interest rate during the execution of `accrueInterest` or a similar function, leading to a possible revert.

### External pre-conditions

 The user specifies a `_maxInterestRate` that is too high, without ensuring that it is within acceptable bounds.

### Attack Path

1. The user creates a borrow order in the , ` specifying a `_maxInterestRate` greater than the calculated interest rate.
2. During the `accrueInterest` function or another borrow-related function, the utilization rate is calculated, but reserves exceed the available cash, causing the utilization to go above 100%.
3. The calculated interest rate exceeds the maximum allowable interest rate, triggering the `require(_maxInterestRate <= maxAllowedApr, "Max APR exceeds allowed limit")` check.
4. The transaction fails, preventing the borrow order from being created and locking the user's funds.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from the inability to process borrow orders when the utilization exceeds 100%, as the interest rate exceeds the maximum allowed. This leads to failed transactions, preventing users from borrowing, repaying, or interacting with the protocol.


### PoC

```solidity
uint maxAllowedApr = 28.5%; // Use a fixed or dynamic cap for maximum APR
require(_maxInterestRate <= maxAllowedApr, "Max APR exceeds allowed limit");

uint borrowRate = calculateBorrowRate();
uint cappedRate = borrowRate > maxAllowedApr ? maxAllowedApr : borrowRate;
```

In this code, the maximum APR is capped at a fixed or dynamic value to avoid exceeding the allowed interest rate, even when utilization exceeds 100%.

### Mitigation

1. **Cap Interest Rate on Borrow Order Creation:** When a borrow order is created, ensure the `_maxInterestRate` is capped and does not exceed a fixed maximum limit, even when utilization exceeds 100%.
   
2. **Recalculate and Cap Interest Rate:** In the functions responsible for calculating the interest rate, ensure that the rate is capped before it is used, like in the example provided.

3. **Safety Check Before Interest Rate Calculation:** Implement a check to verify that the utilization rate is within acceptable bounds. If it exceeds 100%, either revert the transaction or normalize the utilization rate to ensure the interest rate does not become unreasonably high.
