# Inconsistent `isActive` state in `DLOImplementation` enables repeated exploitation of `changePerpetual` to clear factory lend orders

### Summary

The `DLOImplementation` contract has a vulnerability in its state management where the `isActive` flag remains `true` under specific conditions, even when the lend order should be marked as inactive. This inconsistency allows an attacker to repeatedly call the `changePerpetual` function with `_perpetual = false` after the `availableAmount` becomes zero, triggering the deletion of lend orders from the factory. By exploiting this, the attacker can systematically clear all active lend orders in the factory, corrupting the `allActiveLendOrders` array, `LendOrderIndex` mapping, and reducing `activeOrdersCount` to zero, effectively breaking the protocol's functionality.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability arises from **inconsistent state handling** of the `isActive` flag in the `DLOImplementation` contract. Specifically:

1. In the `changePerpetual` function:
   - The `changePerpetual` function does not validate if the lend order is already inactive.
   - When `availableAmount == 0` and `_perpetual = false`, the function triggers a deletion process (`emitDelete` and `deleteOrder`), which can be repeated due to the stale `isActive` state.

2. In the `deleteOrder` function in the factory:
   - The `deleteOrder` function swaps the last element in `allActiveLendOrders` with the one being deleted and decrements `activeOrdersCount`.
   - Repeated calls to `changePerpetual` exploit this logic, systematically clearing the factory's lend order storage.

This inconsistency between the lend order’s actual state and the `isActive` flag allows the attacker to exploit the protocol's deletion mechanism repeatedly.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Lending Offer State**:
   - The `DLOImplementation` instance must have `lendInformation.availableAmount == 0`.
   - The `isActive` flag must still be `true`, which occurs when `_perpetual` was `true` during the `acceptLendingOffer` execution but the cleanup logic (`isActive = false`, `emitDelete`, `deleteOrder`) was skipped.

2. **Perpetual Status**:
   - The `lendInformation.perpetual` value must still be adjustable via the `changePerpetual` function, meaning the contract has not been marked as permanently inactive or restricted.

3. **Factory State**:
   - The lend order must still exist in the factory mappings:
     - `isLendOrderLegit[_lendOrder] == true`
     - `LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder]` must have a valid index.
   - The `allActiveLendOrders` array and `activeOrdersCount` must be intact.

### Attack Path

1. **Create Vulnerable Lend Order**: Attacker creates a lend order with `_perpetual = true`.

2. **Exhaust Lending Amount**: Attacker or a third party calls `acceptLendingOffer` to reduce `availableAmount` to `0`. The `isActive` flag incorrectly remains `true`.

3. **Exploit `changePerpetual`**: Attacker repeatedly calls `changePerpetual(false)`. Each call triggers the factory’s `deleteOrder`, removing the last lend order due to index swapping.

4. **Clear Factory State**: Repeated calls to `changePerpetual(false)` clear the factory’s `allActiveLendOrders` array, corrupt `LendOrderIndex`, and reduce `activeOrdersCount` to `0`, rendering the protocol unusable.

### Impact

The vulnerability allows an attacker to **disrupt the integrity and functionality of the protocol**, leading to the following potential impacts:

1. **System-wide Denial of Service (DoS)**:
   - The attacker can systematically delete all active lend orders from the factory by repeatedly calling the `changePerpetual` function.
   - This corrupts the factory's state, including the `allActiveLendOrders` array, `LendOrderIndex` mapping, and `activeOrdersCount`, rendering the factory unusable.

2. **Loss of Protocol Functionality**:
   - Users of the protocol (both lenders and borrowers) will no longer have access to their active lend orders.
   - The factory will appear empty, and users may lose visibility of their lend order data.

3. **Reputation Damage**:
   - The protocol's reliability and trustworthiness are significantly compromised. 
   - Users may lose confidence in the protocol, leading to reduced participation and potential withdrawal of funds.

4. **Potential Fund Loss**:
   - While the attack does not directly allow the theft of funds, corrupted state management could result in:
     - Collateral or loaned funds becoming inaccessible.
     - Users being unable to reclaim or interact with their lend orders due to the factory’s broken indexing.

5. **Exploitation Costs**:
   - The attack has minimal cost for the attacker since it relies solely on repeated calls to the `changePerpetual` function with `_perpetual = false`, requiring only ownership of a single lend order and sufficient gas.

This vulnerability can effectively disable the protocol's lending operations and disrupt its ability to manage active lend orders, causing widespread damage to the platform's utility and user trust.

### Mitigation

1. **Fix `isActive` State in `changePerpetual`**:
   Ensure `isActive` is set to `false` when `availableAmount` becomes `0`, even if `_perpetual = true`:
   ```solidity
   if (_perpetual == false && lendInformation.availableAmount == 0) {
       isActive = false;
       IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
       IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
   }
   ```
2. **Factory Validation in `deleteOrder`**:
   Add a check in the factory to ensure the lend order is legitimate and has not already been deleted:
   ```solidity
   require(isLendOrderLegit[_lendOrder], "Invalid lend order");
   isLendOrderLegit[_lendOrder] = false;
   ```
