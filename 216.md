# Malicious user can DOS Lend order owners from deleting their orders

### Summary

Debita has factory contract for lend offer, implementation of this contract contains a function for canceling the offer. A malicious user can halt the process of cancelation for everyone such that no lender can cancel his offer.

### Root Cause

In [`DebitaLendOffer-Implementation::144`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L144) The function is to be called whenever the lender wants to cancel his order. This function also calls the `DebitaLendOfferFactory` contract's [`deleteOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207) function that indexes the changes on mappings and decrements the `activeOrdersCount`.

Since the protocol is using solidity version `^0.8.0` thus it protects against Integer Underflow/Overflow. If the `activeOrdersCount` is `0` and there is attempt to `cancel` an order it will revert.

The problem is there that the implementation's `cancelOffer` can be called as many times as the malicious user wants, leading to decrementing the `activeOrdersCount` to `0` and every next attempt to cancel will revert resulting to DOS.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Assume there are 100 Lender orders already created and Alice comes:

1. Alice creates her own Lend order.
2. Alice calls `cancelOffer` of her Lend order.
3. Alice calls `addFunds` in order to increment the `availableAmount` and pass the requirement check of `cancelOffer`
4. Alice repeats `step 2` and `step 3` 101 times decrementing the `activeOrdersCount` to `0`

Now no one can cancel his lend order, unless there is new created one and the `activeOrdersCount` is greater than `0`

### Impact

Lenders will lose the ability to cancel their lend orders.

### PoC

```solidity
    function testDeleteLendOrder() public {
        vm.startPrank(lender);
        IERC20(AERO).approve(lendersOrder, type(uint256).max);

        // There are 10 lend orders, 1 from lender and 9 from other lenders
        // When the lender repeats this 10 times the activeLendOrders will be 0
        for(uint256 i; i < 10; i++) {
            DLOImplementation(lendersOrder).cancelOffer();
            DLOImplementation(lendersOrder).addFunds(1);
        }

        // Expect revert because of integer underflow
        vm.expectRevert();
        DLOImplementation(lendersOrder).cancelOffer();
        vm.stopPrank();

    }
```

```

### Mitigation

Make sure that `isActive` is set to `true` whenever calling the `addFunds` function.

```diff
    function addFunds(uint amount) public nonReentrant {
+       require(isActive, "...");
        require(
            msg.sender == lendInformation.owner ||
                IAggregator(aggregatorContract).isSenderALoan(msg.sender),
            "Only owner or loan"
        );
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        lendInformation.availableAmount += amount;
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
    }
```

In the `DebitaLendOfferFactory` contract set `isLendOrderLegit[msg.sender]` to `false` when the order is deleted

```diff
    function deleteOrder(address _lendOrder) external onlyLendOrder {
        uint index = LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder];
        LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder] = 0;

        // switch index of the last borrow order to the deleted borrow order
        allActiveLendOrders[index] = allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1];
        LendOrderIndex[allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]] = index;

        // take out last borrow order

        allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);
+       isLendOrderLegit[msg.sender] = false;

        activeOrdersCount--;
    }
```
