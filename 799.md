# Variable Shadowing  in changeOwner() in the contract reders the function useless.




### Summary

`changeOwner()` functions in `DebitaAggregatorV3Sol` is useless. Due to the same implmentation mistake , `changeOwner()` in other contracts are also rendered useless.

### Root Cause
From `DebitaAggregatorV3Sol`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L682-L686
```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```

Since the  memoryVariable is declared the same name as the state variable ( `owner` ) , changes in the `owner` only reflects in the  memory.

### Internal pre-conditions
_No response_


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Contracts cannot change the owner of the contract at any circumstances. Rendering the `changeOwner()` functinality useless.

### PoC

test it in remix.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >=0.8.2 <0.9.0;

contract Storage{
    address public owner;
       function sam(address owner) external {
        owner = owner;
    }
```

### Mitigation

change the name of the memory variable other than `owner`
