# Index Zero Collision in DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory Will Break Core Order Management System

### Summary

A critical design flaw in the order indexing system will cause catastrophic order management failures and potential permanent fund lockups, as the system cannot distinguish between valid and deleted orders due to both sharing index 0. This fundamentally breaks the protocol's ability to manage borrow positions reliably.the same issue is in the `DebitaLendOfferFactory` and ``buyOrderFactory``

### Root Cause

In `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol:171` the order management system has a critical design flaw in how it handles order indexing:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L99-L105
```solidity
function deleteBorrowOrder(address _borrowOrder) external onlyBorrowOrder {
    uint index = borrowOrderIndex[_borrowOrder];
    borrowOrderIndex[_borrowOrder] = 0;  // Critical: Reuses index 0 for deleted orders
    ...
}
```

The system uses index 0 for two conflicting purposes:
1. Identifying the first valid order in the system
2. Marking deleted orders

This dual use of index 0 creates an unresolvable state confusion in the order tracking system.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Protocol needs to have at least one active borrow order with `borrowOrderIndex[orderA] = 0`
2. Protocol needs to have a second borrow order with `borrowOrderIndex[orderB] = 1`
3. System's `activeOrdersCount` must be greater than `1`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Let's say we have two orders in the system:

1. Order A (First Order):
   - Index: 0
   - Collateral: 10 ETH
   - Status: Active
   - Loan Amount: 5000 USDC

2. Order B (Second Order):
   - Index: 1
   - Collateral: 20 ETH
   - Status: Active
   - Loan Amount: 10000 USDC

When Order B is deleted:
- Both orders now have index 0
- System can't tell if Order B's 20 ETH position is really deleted
- Interest calculations might still apply to Order B
- Order A's 10 ETH position might be treated as invalid
- Total affected funds: 30 ETH and 15000 USDC at risk

### Impact

   - Order tracking becomes unreliable
   - Wrong interest calculations
   - Invalid liquidations

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

start  from one calculation the indexes 
in the contractor 
```js 
activeOrdersCount=1; 
```
