### Attack Path

Assume that Bob creates a borrow offer. When the Loan is matched, the `Aggregator(AggregatorContract).feePerDay()` is equal to 10 (0.1%), and the `borrowInfo.duration` is 8 days. Thus, the `percentage` will be equal to 80 (0.1% * 8 days = 0.8%).

At $T0$, assume that Bob should receive 1,000,000 USDC as principle tokens from the Loan (`amountPerPrinciple[i] = 1000 USDC`). In this case, he would need to pay a fee of 8000 USDC (1,000,000 * 0.8% ) as the fee, and he will only receiveve 992,000 USDC

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Aggregator.sol
391:         uint percentage = ((borrowInfo.duration * feePerDay) / 86400);
..SNIP..
543:             // calculate fees --> msg.sender keeps 15% of the fee for connecting the offers
544:             uint feeToPay = (amountPerPrinciple[i] * percentage) / 10000;
545:             uint feeToConnector = (feeToPay * feeCONNECTOR) / 10000;
546:             feePerPrinciple[i] = feeToPay;
```

At $T1$, Bob decided to extend the loan via the `extendLoan()` function. However, at this point, the `Aggregator(AggregatorContract).feePerDay()` has been updated to 5 (0.05%).

Thus, the `PorcentageOfFeePaid` computed at Line 571 below equal to 0.4% (0.05% * 8 days = 0.4%).

The first issue here is that earlier at $T0$, Bob actually paid 0.8% (8000 USDC) worth of fee. However, now, the protocol wrongly assumes that Bob has only paid 0.4% worth of the fee, which is incorrect.

Assume that the `offer.maxDeadline` is 10 days. Thus, the `feeOfMaxDeadline` calculated at Line 602 will be 0.5% (10 days * 0.05 = 0.5%). With the new duration of 10 days, the protocol expects Bob to pay 0.5% of the offer's principle amount (1,000,000), which is equal to 5000 USDC (1,000,000 * 0.5% =5,000).

```solidity
misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid
misingBorrowFee = 0.5% - 0.4% = 0.1%
```

The protocol determined that Bob still needs to pay an additional of 0.1% worth of fee, which is equal to 1000 USDC. The protocol will transfer 1000 USDC from Bob's wallet to be paid as fee.

However, the math is incorrect. Protocol has determined that Bob is subjected to a 5000 USDC fee after extending the loan with a longer duration. Bob has already paid 8000 USDC earlier at $T0$. Thus, Bob has already paid more than 5000 USDC, yet the protocol proceeds to charge an additional fee of 1000 USDC. At the end, with the computed fee of 5000 USDC, Bob ends up paying 9000 USDC (8000 + 1000).

601:                     // calculate difference from fee paid for the initialDuration vs the extra fee they should pay because of the extras days of extending the loan.  MAXFEE shouldnt be higher than extra fee + PorcentageOfFeePaid
602:                     uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /
603:                         86400);
604:                     if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
605:                         feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
606:                     } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) {
607:                         feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
608:                     }
609: 
610:                     misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
611:                 }
612:                 uint principleAmount = offer.principleAmount;
613:                 uint feeAmount = (principleAmount * misingBorrowFee) / 10000;
```

The previous example describes a scenario where `Aggregator(AggregatorContract).feePerDay()` is decreased. However, if the `Aggregator(AggregatorContract).feePerDay()` is increased, the opposite will happen. In this case, the protocol will be the victim instead of the users, and the protocol will undercharge the fee and assume that Bob has already paid a certain amount of fee, while in reality did not.

### Impact

High. Loss of assets. In the above scenario, Bob ends up paying an additional 1000 USDC while, in fact, this is not required because he has already paid more than sufficient fees earlier. Alternatively, the protocol might undercharge the users.

Note that due to the newly updated Sherlock's judging rules (shown below), issues that the admin might unknowingly cause when updating a state variable, such as the issue described here, are considered valid.

### Mitigation

Consider caching the actual fee used at the point of time the Loan/Offer is created and matched within the `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol.matchOffersV3` function instead of fetching it dynamically from the `AggregatorContract` contract.
