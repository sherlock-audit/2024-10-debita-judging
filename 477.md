# The `MixOracle` will stop functioning due to an overflow in the `TarotOracle`.

### Summary

The [`TarotOracle`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/MixOracle/TarotOracle/TarotPriceOracle.sol#L7) contract is an oracle specifically designed to retrieve prices from UniswapV2 pairs or EQUALIZER. This type of oracles are initially developed to work with a `solc` version < 0.8.0 (the same version used by UniswapV2), but the protocol itself operates with `solc` > 0.8.0, meaning the contract is using the same.

#### Why was it originally designed for `solc` < 0.8.0?

The reason for using a version < 0.8.0 was to allow overflows. 

The `TarotOracle` contract was built based on Uniswapâ€™s documentation for integrating with UniswapV2/EQUALIZER:
- [UniswapV2 Oracle Guide](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/guides/smart-contract-integration/building-an-oracle)

In this documentation, there's a section called **Notes On Overflow** that explains:
>#### Notes on overflow
> The UniswapV2Pair cumulative price variables are designed to eventually overflow. Specifically, `price0CumulativeLast`, `price1CumulativeLast`, and `blockTimestampLast` will overflow through 0.

Additionally, the `TarotOracle` contract itself contains comments that allow for silent overflows. For example, in the `getPriceCumulativeCurrent` function, we see the following comments:

```solidity
    function getPriceCumulativeCurrent(
        address uniswapV2Pair
    ) internal view returns (uint256 priceCumulative) {
        priceCumulative = IUniswapV2Pair(uniswapV2Pair)
            .reserve0CumulativeLast();
        (
            uint112 reserve0,
            uint112 reserve1,
            uint32 _blockTimestampLast
        ) = IUniswapV2Pair(uniswapV2Pair).getReserves();
        uint224 priceLatest = UQ112x112.encode(reserve1).uqdiv(reserve0);
>>      uint32 timeElapsed = getBlockTimestamp() - _blockTimestampLast; // overflow is desired
>>      // * never overflows, and + overflow is desired
        priceCumulative += (uint256(priceLatest) * timeElapsed);
    }
```

From this, we can conclude that when `TarotOracle` is used in `MixOracle`, there will come a point where `TarotOracle` will overflow (due to operating with solc > 0.8.0). At this stage, `MixOracle` would stop functioning properly, and the contract would need to be redeployed.

**Note**: While the `TarotOracle` contract is currently out-of-scope, if we can address the issue by adding a function within `MixOracle` to deploy a new version of `TarotOracle` when an overflow occurs, I believe this issue might be valid.


### Root Cause

Inside [`MixOracle`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/MixOracle/MixOracle.sol#L19), the failure to deploy a new `TarotOracle` when it overflows.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- The protocol functions normally, using the oracles to handle transactions.
- After some time, Alice makes a transaction in the protocol where the price of `EQUAL/USD` is needed, but neither the `Pyth` nor `Chainlink` Oracles provide this price. The protocol then uses the `MixOracle`, which in turn uses the `TarotOracle` to get the price of `EQUAL/wFTM` and the `Pyth` Oracle to get `wFTM/USD`.
- After extensive use, the `TarotOracle` eventually overflows when attempting to fetch the price of `EQUAL/wFTM`, causing the `MixOracle` to become ineffective. Consequently, the contracts must be redeployed.

### Impact

Functionality of the `MixOracle` halts when the `TarotOracle` starts overflowing.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Every time the `TarotOracle` overflows, deploy a new instance to ensure the continued use of the `MixOracle`.
