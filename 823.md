# Local Variable Shadowing in `changeOwner` function

### Summary

The `changeOwner` function has the vulnerability of overshadowing variable `owner` as they share the same name as the state variable.

### Root Cause

In `AuctionFactory.sol:218`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218-L222

In `buyOrderFactory.sol:186`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186-L190

In `DebitaV3Aggregator:682`

### Impact

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```
This 
This could lead to loss of ownership transfer functionality as the ownership will not be rendered. 
If the function is called during the permitted 6 hour window but fails to update the state due to shadowing, legitimate owner may lose their ability to transfer ownership later, which could potentially lead to loss of fund as well.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use distinct names for function parameters and state variables. For example:
```solidity
function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = newOwner;
}
```
