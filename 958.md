# DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3 incorrectly transfers principle from itself

### Summary

DebitaV3Aggregator transfers principle from itself to the loan contract .The issue with this is that the principle is not held by the aggregator contract but by the lendOffer contract.


### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3` the loan principle is transfered from the aggregator contract to the loan contract as seen here
the issue is that the aggregator contract does not hold the principle for the loan.
The loan principle is held by the lendOffer contract as we see here in the `DLOFactory::createLendOrder` function

```solidity
        for (uint i; i < principles.length; i++) {
            SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
                IERC20(principles[i]),
                borrowInfo.owner,
                amountPerPrinciple[i] - feePerPrinciple[i]
            );
