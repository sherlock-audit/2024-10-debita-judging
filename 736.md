# buyOrder owner will lose his NFT in sellNFT()

### Summary

buyOrder owner will lose his NFT in sellNFT()

### Root Cause

In [sellNFT()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92C5-L103C11), nft is transfered to contract itself instead of transferring to buyOrder owner. Also there is no way that owner can withdraw that nft from the contract.
```solidity
function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
////

        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
->          address(this),
            receiptID
        );
///
```
