# Blacklisted borrower can block loan liquidation, causing bad debt for the protocol

### Summary

The lack of handling for blacklisted addresses during USDC transfers will cause failed loan liquidations for the protocol, as transactions revert when transferring USDC to a blacklisted borrower.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan.sol`, during the collateral claim and liquidation processes, the contract attempts to transfer USDC (or any ERC20 token) to the borrower without checking if the borrower is blacklisted by the USDC contract. If the borrower is blacklisted, the transfer will revert, preventing the completion of the liquidation or collateral claim.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.Borrower is blacklisted: The borrower's address has been blacklisted by the USDC token contract.
2.Active loan: The borrower has an active loan that is due for liquidation or collateral return.

### External pre-conditions

USDC token contract blacklist: The USDC token contract has blacklisted the borrower's address, disallowing transfers to that address.

### Attack Path

1. Loan due for liquidation: The borrower's loan becomes due for liquidation, or the borrower attempts to claim their collateral after repayment.
2. Contract attempts transfer: The DebitaV3Loan contract calls a function to transfer USDC to the borrower's address.
3. Transfer reverts: The transfer fails and reverts because the USDC contract blocks transfers to blacklisted addresses.
4. Liquidation blocked: The failed transfer causes the entire transaction to revert, preventing loan liquidation or collateral return.

### Impact

The protocol cannot liquidate the loan or return collateral, leading to potential bad debt and locked funds. Lenders may not recover their funds, and the protocol's financial stability is at risk.

### PoC

```solidity
// Assume borrower is blacklisted by USDC
address blacklistedBorrower = /* blacklisted address */;
DebitaV3Loan loanContract = DebitaV3Loan(/* loan contract address */);

// Borrower attempts to claim collateral
// This will revert due to transfer to a blacklisted address
loanContract.claimCollateralERC20AsBorrower(/* indexes */);

// During liquidation, the contract attempts to transfer USDC
// to the blacklisted borrower, causing the transaction to revert
```

### Mitigation

Implement Blacklist Checks: Before performing transfers, check if the recipient address is blacklisted by USDC. If so, handle the situation by:
- Holding the funds in escrow until the borrower is removed from the blacklist.
- Allowing the borrower to specify an alternate address that is not blacklisted.
- Graceful Failure Handling: Modify contract logic to handle transfer failures without reverting the entire transaction. For example:
Use a try-catch block when performing the transfer.
- If the transfer fails, record the failed transfer and allow the rest of the liquidation process to continue.
Use Alternative Tokens or Mechanisms:
- Allow settlements in alternative tokens that do not have blacklist features.
- Provide options for borrowers to claim collateral in a different form or through a different method.
