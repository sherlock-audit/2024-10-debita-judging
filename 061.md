# Mismatched Array Length Limits in matchOffersV3 and DebitaV3Loan initialize Functions

### Summary

The `matchOffersV3 function` in the `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol` contract checks that the number of lend orders does not [exceed 100](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L290). However, the initialize function in the `DebitaV3Loan.sol` contract checks that the number of accepted [offers does not exceed 30](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L156). This inconsistency can cause valid transactions with more than `30 offers` to fail during the initialization of a loan.


### Impact

While the bug does not pose a security risk, it disrupts expected functionality and may lead to user dissatisfaction or inefficiencies of the protocol as it does not lead to a single source of truth.
