# Borrower will pay double fee to the lenders

### Summary

Borrower is intended to pay the interest from the start till the time we repay the loan via  `payDebt()`.

But before calling `payDebt()`, he may want to extend the loan via `extendLoan()` a little before the end of the initial duration of the loan.

The issue stems from that the user will pay interest to the lender from the start of the loan till the time he invokes `extendLoan()` and when we finally decides to repay the loan via `payDebt()`, he will again pay from the start till the end of the loan - basically we do not account for the difference that was already paid in `extendLoan()`

[Here is the payment from the borrower to the DebitaV3Loan.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L615-L620)

[calculateInterestToPay()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L721-L738) calculates the interest **from the start of the loan till the current time**, so if the loan is 
 from the 1st of November till the 30th and the function is internally used in `extendLoan()` as it is in the code at 28th of November 
 - it will calculate the interest from the 1st to the 28th.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that the borrower will double pay the lenders if he decides to extend the loan via `extendLoan()`, because he will pay interest again from the start of the loan till the repayment happens in `payDebt()`.

The interest payment in `extendLoan()` should not have happened in the first place or it should have been somehow accounted for so that in `payDebt()` we do not pay interest a second time for a period that we've already paid
.
The interest payment should be reserved in the `payDebt()` specifically or should have been accounted for in `extendLoan()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

The user invokes `extendLoan()` in the period of the initial duration

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `Alice` is a borrower and has her borrowing offer matched against one or more lenders - the initial duration is 1th of November till the 30th of November
2. `Alice` decides to extend the loan at the 28th of November (a little before the end of the initial duration) to its max duration via `extendLoan()` which will be the 25th of December
3. `Alice` will have to pay the interest to the lender/lenders from the 1st of November till the 28th of November
4. `Alice` then decides to invoke `payDebt()` at 23th of December to cover the entire debt (principal + interest), but she will have to pay interest to the lenders from the 1st of November till 23th of December which should not been done, because she had already paid from the 1st of November till the 28th of November - this will lead to her paying more than she should have paid, resulting in loss of funds.

### Impact

User wrongly pays again for the time period he has already paid, resulting in a loss of funds to the user.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Account for the amount that the user has already paid or do not pay the lender in `extendLoan()`, only in `payDebt()`
