# updateFunds may miss some whiteListedPair due to incorrect use of `return`

### Summary

The DebitaV3Aggregator will call `updateFunds` if match offer successfully. The function `updateFunds` only consider the token pair `[infomration[i].principle, collateral]` which is in whitelist. 
But due to incorrect use `return` in `updateFunds`, it may miss some valid pair. This will result in the incentives corresponding to the offer not being processed. 

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L306

```solidity
    function updateFunds(
        infoOfOffers[] memory informationOffers,
        address collateral,
        address[] memory lenders,
        address borrower
    ) public onlyAggregator {
        for (uint i = 0; i < lenders.length; i++) {
            bool validPair = isPairWhitelisted[informationOffers[i].principle][
                collateral
            ];
            
            //@audit the following principle will not take into account, even it is in whitelist.  
            if (!validPair) {
                return;
            }
           //...
}
```
The function use `return` when meet one token pair is not in whitelist.But this will miss the following valid pair.
For example, there are 2 offers. 
```solidity
offer1: priniciple = token1, collateral = token2, isWhiteListed[token1][token2] = false
offer2: priniciple = token3, collateral = token2, isWhiteListed[token3][token2] = true
```
The function `updateFunds` will return when process `offer1` and miss `offer2` which is valid. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The loan has more than 2 offer. 
2. There exists [principle, collateral] token pair which is not in DebitaIncentive's whitelist. 
3. There is a legal offer behind the illegal offer.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The lender and borrower will lose incentive funds.  

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use continue instead of return. 
```solidity
            if (!validPair) {
                continue;
            }
```
