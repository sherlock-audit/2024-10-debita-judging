# TWAP Manipulation Risk in `TarotPriceOracle


**Location:** `contracts/oracles/MixOracle/TarotOracle/TarotPriceOracle.sol`

---

**Issue:**

The `[TarotPriceOracle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/MixOracle/TarotOracle/TarotPriceOracle.sol#L33-L47)` contract is susceptible to price manipulation due to the following reasons:

- **Short TWAP Window:** The Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) window is set to a minimum of 20 minutes (`MIN_T = 1200` seconds), which is insufficient to mitigate manipulation risks.
- **Use of Instantaneous Reserves:** The oracle relies on current reserves from the Uniswap V2 pair for price calculations, making it vulnerable to flash loan attacks and other rapid trading strategies.

**Code Snippet:**

```solidity
// Minimum time window is only 20 minutes
uint32 public constant MIN_T = 1200; 

function getPriceCumulativeCurrent(address uniswapV2Pair) internal view {
    // Uses instantaneous reserves which can be manipulated
    (uint112 reserve0, uint112 reserve1, uint32 _blockTimestampLast) = 
        IUniswapV2Pair(uniswapV2Pair).getReserves();
    uint224 priceLatest = UQ112x112.encode(reserve1).uqdiv(reserve0);
}
```

---

**Impact:**

- **Price Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the reserves through flash loans or large trades within the short TWAP window, causing the oracle to report skewed prices.
- **Financial Losses:** Contracts relying on this oracle may execute trades or liquidations based on manipulated prices, leading to potential financial losses for users and the protocol.

**Recommendation:**

1. **Increase the TWAP Window:**

   Extending the TWAP window reduces the impact of short-term price manipulations.

   ```solidity
   // Increase TWAP window to 1 hour
   uint32 public constant MIN_T = 3600; // 1 hour minimum
   ```

2. **Use Cumulative Prices:**

   Implement cumulative price data from Uniswap V2 pairs, which are less susceptible to manipulation than instantaneous reserves.

3. **Implement Price Deviation Checks:**

   Introduce checks to detect and prevent significant price deviations.

   ```solidity
   uint256 public constant MAX_DEVIATION = 5; // Maximum allowed deviation in percent

   function validatePrice(uint224 price) internal view returns (bool) {
       uint224 lastPrice = getLastValidPrice();
       uint224 deviation = (price > lastPrice) ? (price - lastPrice) : (lastPrice - price);
       uint224 deviationPercentage = (deviation * 100) / lastPrice;
       return deviationPercentage <= MAX_DEVIATION;
   }
   ```

4. **Regular Price Updates:**

   Ensure that the oracle updates prices at regular intervals to maintain accuracy.
