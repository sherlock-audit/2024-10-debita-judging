# Lack of handling for unclaimed incentives causes permanent lockup of funds

## **Summary**
The `DebitaIncentives` contract allows the creation of incentives tied to a specific tuple of principle, collateral, and epoch. However, if no borrower-lender pair matches the specified tuple, the incentives remain unclaimed indefinitely. The contract lacks any mechanism to handle or recover such locked incentives, potentially leading to wasted resources and financial inefficiency.

## **Impact**
1. **Permanent Fund Lockup:**
   - Incentives associated with unmatched tuples are irretrievably locked in the contract.

2. **Economic Inefficiency:**
   - Locked funds cannot be reallocated or repurposed, reducing the overall effectiveness of the incentive mechanism.

## **Mitigation**
1. **Add a Recovery Mechanism:**
   - Implement a function to allow the creator of an incentive to reclaim funds if the incentive remains unclaimed for a defined period.

2. **Incentive Expiration:**
   - Introduce an expiration mechanism for unused incentives. Incentives tied to tuples with no activity within a specific epoch range should expire and become reclaimable.

3. **Incentive Reallocation:**
   - Allow incentives tied to infeasible tuples to be reassigned to other valid tuples.
