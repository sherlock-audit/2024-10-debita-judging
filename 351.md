# Miscalculation of `extendedTime` During Loan Extension

### Summary

An incorrect calculation in `extendLoan` will cause a denial of service for borrowers as the `extendedTime` variable can result in zero, leading to unexpected transaction reverts when borrowers attempt to extend their loans.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Loan.extendLoan: 590](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/376fec45be95bd4bbc929fd37b485076b03ab8b0/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L590), the `extendedTime` is calculated as follows:

```solidity
uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - alreadyUsedTime - block.timestamp;
```
The subtraction of `block.timestamp` and `alreadyUsedTime` from `offer.maxDeadline` does not logically reflect the remaining loan extension time and can result in always zero or transaction reverts. It's a Miscalculation for `extendedTime`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `offer.maxDeadline` must be less than or equal to `alreadyUsedTime + block.timestamp`.
2. Borrower calls `extendLoan()` with valid initial conditions for loan extension.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Borrower holds a valid loan and decides to extend it.
2. Borrower calls `extendLoan()` under conditions where `offer.maxDeadline <= alreadyUsedTime + block.timestamp`.
3. The calculation of `extendedTime` results in an invalid value.


### Impact

Borrower Impact: Borrowers cannot extend their loans, potentially leading to unintended defaults. Denial of service for loan extensions, impacting both borrowers and the overall health of the lending system.

### PoC

Sample scenario:

1. m_loan.startedAt = 10
2. block.timestamp = 20
3. offer.maxDeadline = 30
4. alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt == 20 - 10 = 10
5. extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - alreadyUsedTime - block.timestamp; == 30 - 10 - 20 = 0

### Mitigation

Confirmed by Sponsor, calculation for `extendedTime` is: 
```solidity
uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - offer.startedAt;
```
