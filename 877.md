# Incorrect Borrower/Lender Identification in `tokenURI()` Logic

### Summary

The [DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol::tokenURI()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol) function uses the parity of `tokenId` to differentiate between borrowers and lenders, setting ` _type` to "Borrower" for even tokenIds and "Lender" for odd tokenIds. However, this logic fails in scenarios where the assignment of tokenId does not conform to this parity rule, leading to incorrect metadata for the NFTs. This could mislead users and cause inconsistencies in loan representations.

### Root Cause

When a `matchOffer` is created through [matchOfferV3()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L502) the lendOrders get minted an `Ownership` token in a sequential order before the borrowerOrder.

### Impact


**Incorrect NFT Metadata:** Borrowers may be labeled as lenders and vice versa, causing confusion among users relying on the metadata for decision-making.

### PoC

If the loan created  through `matchOfferV3()` is composed by 5 lenders and 1 borrower, then lenders will have tokenIds 1..5 and borrower 6. Therefore the lender in positions 2,4 will be granted a token with those ids. If you call the `DebitaLoanOwnership::tokenURI()` of tokens 2,4 the `_type` parameter will classify them as borrowers instead of lenders. Thus returning incorrect metadata for the token.

### Mitigation


A possible implemenetation will be to pass the `_type` as a boolean on `mint(address, boolean)`  in [mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol#L34)and store it in a mapping;
```solidity
mapping(uint256 => bool) public isBorrower;
string memory _type = isBorrower[tokenId] ? "Borrower" : "Lender";
```
