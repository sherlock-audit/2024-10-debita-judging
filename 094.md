# Missing Stale Price Validation in Chainlink Price Feed

## Summary

The `getPrice` function in the `DebitaChainlink` contract fetches price data using Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` but fails to validate the data's freshness by checking `updatedAt` or `roundId`. This oversight risks using stale or outdated prices in the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the [DebitaChainlink](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/376fec45be95bd4bbc929fd37b485076b03ab8b0/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L30-L47) contract, the protocol leverages a Chainlink price feed to retrieve data via the `latestRoundData()` function. However, the implementation does not verify whether the returned data is fresh or outdated.

```js
 function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price; 
    }
```
While the code checks if the price is greater than zero, this validation alone is insufficient to ensure the reliability of the price feed.([Chainlink's official documentation](https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds))

## Impact

Without validating the recency of the price data, the system might use outdated or stale values, potentially causing incorrect calculations in the protocol.

## Tools

VS Code

## Recommendation

Modify the code to include additional checks for `roundId` and `updatedAt` fields returned by `latestRoundData()`. Ensure that the retrieved data belongs to the most recent round and that the updatedAt timestamp is within an acceptable threshold to guarantee data freshness.
