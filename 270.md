# Broken functionality Ownership Transfer Failure Due to Parameter Shadowing

### Summary

The `changeOwner` function in the `DebitaV3Aggregator`,  `buyOrderFactory` and AuctionFactory.sol` contract contains a critical vulnerability that prevents ownership transfer  due to parameter shadowing.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218-L222

### Root Cause

The parameter name owner shadows the state variable owner, causing the assignment to modify the parameter instead of the state variable. This results in the state variable remaining unchanged and revert with the error:`Only Owner`

### Internal pre-conditions

- Contract must be within 6 hours of deployment
- Caller must be the current owner

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

High severity
- Ownership transfer functionality is broken
- Could lead to contract lockdown if relied upon for critical operations
- May cause coordination issues between parties expecting ownership changes

- All privileged functions become inaccessible after attempted transfer:
`statusCreateNewOffers`, `setValidNFTCollateral`,`setNewFee`, `setNewMaxFee`,`setNewMinFee`, `setNewFeeConnector`, `setOracleEnabled`

### PoC

```solidity

        DebitaV3Aggregator _DebitaV3AggregatorContract = new DebitaV3Aggregator(
            address(DLOFactoryContract),
            address(DBOFactoryContract),
            address(incentivesContract),
            address(ownershipsContract),
            address(factory),
            address(loanInstance)
        );

        DebitaV3AggregatorContract = _DebitaV3AggregatorContract;
       


        vm.startPrank( DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner());
       DebitaV3AggregatorContract.changeOwner(creator);
       vm.stopPrank();
       console.log("DebitaV3AggregatorContract new owner", DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner());
      assertEq(DebitaV3AggregatorContract.owner(), creator, "New owner should be creator")
     ```

[FAIL. Reason: setup failed: revert: Only owner] setUp() (gas: 0)

### Mitigation

The fix includes:

Renaming the parameter to avoid shadowing
Adding zero address validation
Adding event emission for transparency
Properly updating the state variable

```solidity
function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
   require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
   require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
   require(newOwner != address(0), "New owner is zero address");
   
   address oldOwner = owner;
   owner = newOwner;
   
   emit OwnershipTransferred(oldOwner, newOwner);
}

event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);
```
