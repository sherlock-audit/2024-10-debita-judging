# auction buyer can lose nft

### Summary

when transferring the nft to the user the contracts uses safetransfer instead of transfer

    function buyNFT() public onlyActiveAuction {
        // get memory data
        dutchAuction_INFO memory m_currentAuction = s_CurrentAuction;
        // get current price of the auction
        uint currentPrice = getCurrentPrice();
        // desactivate auction from storage
        s_CurrentAuction.isActive = false;
        uint fee;
        if (m_currentAuction.isLiquidation) {
            fee = auctionFactory(factory).auctionFee();
        } else {
            fee = auctionFactory(factory).publicAuctionFee();
        }


        // calculate fee
        uint feeAmount = (currentPrice * fee) / 10000;
        // get fee address
        address feeAddress = auctionFactory(factory).feeAddress();
        // Transfer liquidation token from the buyer to the owner of the auction
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
            msg.sender,
            s_ownerOfAuction,
            currentPrice - feeAmount
        );


        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
            msg.sender,
            feeAddress,
            feeAmount
        );


        // If it's a liquidation, handle it properly
        if (m_currentAuction.isLiquidation) {
            debitaLoan(s_ownerOfAuction).handleAuctionSell(
                currentPrice - feeAmount
            );
        }
        IERC721 Token = IERC721(s_CurrentAuction.nftAddress);
        Token.safeTransferFrom( //---->use of safetransfer


The contract attempts to transfer the tokens using `safeTransferFrom`. The `safeTransferFrom` method ensures that the recipient contract implements the `ERC721TokenReceiver` interface. If the recipient does not support receiving `ERC721` tokens (i.e., it does not implement `ERC721TokenReceiver`), the transfer will revert
