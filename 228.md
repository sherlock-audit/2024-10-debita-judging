# Borrowers will face excessive principal loss due to incorrect fee calculation(`feeOfMaxDeadline`) in loan extension

### Summary

The miscalculation of `feeOfMaxDeadline` in the `extendLoan` function will cause excessive principal loss for borrowers as the function treats `offer.maxDeadline` as a duration instead of a timestamp, leading to inflated fees and higher deductions during loan extension.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan.sol:602`, the `feeOfMaxDeadline` calculation incorrectly treats `offer.maxDeadline` (a timestamp) as a duration, causing an inflated fee value:
```solidity
uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) / 86400);
```

This results in excessively high fees (`misingBorrowFee`) being charged to borrowers during loan extensions.

### Attack Path

1. The borrower calls the `extendLoan()` function to extend the loan duration.  
2. The function validates initial conditions:
   - `loanData.extended` is `false`.  
   - `nextDeadline()` returns a timestamp greater than `block.timestamp`.  
   - `offer.maxDeadline` is a future timestamp.  
3. The `feeOfMaxDeadline` is calculated incorrectly using the formula:  
   ```solidity
   uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) / 86400);
   ```
   treating `offer.maxDeadline` as a duration instead of a timestamp, resulting in an inflated fee value.  
4. The excessive `feeOfMaxDeadline` leads to a disproportionately high `misingBorrowFee`, which is deducted from the borrower's principal.  
5. The borrower loses a significant portion of their principal to inflated fees when attempting to extend their loan.  

### Impact

Borrowers will face excessive principal loss due to inflated fees during loan extension. This could result in financial hardship for borrowers, discourage loan extensions, and erode trust in the platform. Additionally, the inflated fees may lead to legal and reputational risks for the platform as borrowers perceive the deductions as exploitative or unfair.

### Mitigation

```solidity
uint MaxDeadDuration = offer.maxDeadline - m_loan.startedAt;
uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((MaxDeadDuration * feePerDay) / 86400);
```
