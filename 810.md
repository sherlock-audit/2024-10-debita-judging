# borrowId will never get burned even though the collatteral has been settled completely for a loan.



### Summary

Once the complete `collateral` of the `loan` has been claimed and paid , the `borrowerId` which represents the `ownerShip` of a `loan`'s borrowOrder should be burned because its is no more valid. And hence it shouldnt remain in the market.

This behaviour, though obvious is also mentioned in the code section [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L515)

```solidity
=> // In case every offer has been claimed & paid, burn the borrower ownership
        if (
            offersCollateralClaimed_Borrower == loanData._acceptedOffers.length 
        ) {
            ownershipContract.burn(loanData.borrowerID);
        }
```

But `borrowerId`  can never be burned in the case when atleast one `offer`'s `collatteral` is claimed by the `lender`.

### Root Cause

The collatteral that a loan upholds can either be claimed by the borrower if he has already paid the debt or the lender when the borrower fails to pay the debt.

We have a `offersCollateralClaimed_Borrower` variable which stores for how many offers the borrower has claimed its allocated collatteral.

But right now , protocol hasnt defined a variable to track   how many offers lenders has claimed their collateral for.

Now in the function `claimCollateralAsBorrower()` , there is a check `offersCollateralClaimed_Borrower == loanData._acceptedOffers.length` , and if the check satisfies the borrowerId is burned impling that the loan is all settled.

```solidity
        if (
            offersCollateralClaimed_Borrower == loanData._acceptedOffers.length
        ) {
            ownershipContract.burn(loanData.borrowerID);
        }
```

but this check will  only compare the number of offers the borrower has claimed, hence if atleast a lender has already claimed their collatteral after the deadline,
` ownershipContract.burn(loanData.borrowerID);` will never gets executed.

So even though all the collatteral of the loan is settled and paid accordingly , the loan will be still considered as active due to the presence of the borrowId. The borrowId NFT , can still be remain active in the market , affecting the protocols design.

### Internal pre-conditions
borrower fails to pay atleast one offer.


### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Impacting the protocol design by allowing the invalid `ownershipId` of a loan , which has been settled and paid, to remain active in the market.

Challenge the necessity of the `OwnershipContract`, which is intended to provide users with information about the validity of `borrowId` before acquiring the `borrowId token`, so its functionality is effectively rendered useless.

### PoC
_No response_

### Mitigation


track the offers where the Collateral is Claimed by the lender using offersCollateralClaimed_Lender.
and add the check  in both claimCollateralAsBorrower()  and claimCollateralAsLender()  function
```solidity
        if (
            offersCollateralClaimed_Borrower + offersCollateralClaimed_Lender == loanData._acceptedOffers.length
        ) {
            ownershipContract.burn(loanData.borrowerID);
        }
```
