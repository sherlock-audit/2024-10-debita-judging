# Token Decimals Limitation will Block Liquidation for Tokens with >18 Decimals

### Summary

In DutchAuction_veNFT.sol:29, the hard requirement that token decimals must be ≤18 will prevent liquidation auctions from being created for tokens with higher decimal places, causing liquidation mechanisms to fail for affected collateral tokens. This breaks the core liquidation functionality of the protocol for certain token types.

### Root Cause

```solidity
uint difference = 18 - decimalsSellingToken;
```
The assumption that all tokens have ≤18 decimals is incorrect, as some tokens (e.g., YAM-V2) use more than 18 decimals.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Protocol must have accepted a token with >18 decimals as valid collateral
2. A loan using this token as collateral must have defaulted
3. Protocol attempts to liquidate the defaulted position through auction

### External pre-conditions

1. A collateral token with >18 decimals must exist in the protocol
2. The loan using this collateral must have passed its deadline without repayment

### Attack Path

1. User takes out a loan using a token with >18 decimals as collateral
2. User defaults on the loan
3. Protocol attempts to create liquidation auction
4. Auction creation fails due to decimal limitation
5. Liquidation process is blocked
6. Defaulted collateral becomes permanently locked in the protocol

### Impact

The protocol suffers from inability to liquidate certain defaulted positions, leading to:

1. Locked collateral that cannot be liquidated
2. Lenders cannot recover their funds through normal liquidation process
3. Protocol's risk management system partially fails
4. Economic loss to lenders equal to the full value of loans backed by >18 decimal tokens

### PoC

```solidity
    function testUnsupportedTokenDecimals() public {
        // Mock token with more than 18 decimals
        ERC20Mock unsupportedToken = new ERC20Mock("Unsupported Token", "UTK", 20);
        deal(address(unsupportedToken), signer, 100e20, false);

        vm.startPrank(signer);
        unsupportedToken.approve(address(ABIERC721Contract), 100e20);
        uint id = ABIERC721Contract.createLock(100e18, 365 * 4 * 86400);
        ABIERC721Contract.approve(address(factory), id);

        try factory.createAuction(
            id,
            veAERO,
            address(unsupportedToken),
            100e20,
            10e20,
            86400
        ) {
            fail("Auction creation should fail for tokens with more than 18 decimals");
        } catch Error(string memory reason) {
            assertEq(reason, "ERC20: decimals greater than 18 not supported");
        }
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

Recommended: Remove the decimal limitation and modify the price calculation logic:
```solidity
// Remove the require check
// uint difference = 18 - decimalsSellingToken;
uint normalizedDecimals = decimalsSellingToken > 18 ? 
    decimalsSellingToken - 18 : 
    18 - decimalsSellingToken;
uint adjustmentFactor = decimalsSellingToken > 18 ? 
    10 ** normalizedDecimals : 
    1 / (10 ** normalizedDecimals);
```
