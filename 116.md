# The implementation of `TaxTokensReceipt` incorrectly supports fee-on-transfer tokens.

### Summary

`TaxTokensReceipt` supports fee-on-transfer tokens, but the contract is incorrectly implemented, causing fee-on-transfer token transfers to always fail.

### Root Cause

The `deposit` function is incorrectly implemented to support fee-on-transfer tokens.
```solidity
    // expect that owners of the token will excempt from tax this contract
    function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
        return tokenID;
    }
```

Fee-on-transfer tokens deduct a portion of the transferred `amount` as a fee, so the final token balance change in the contract will always be less than `amount`. As a result, the above check will always fail.

### Attack Path

### Impact

The `TaxTokensReceipts` contract fails to support fee-on-transfer tokens as intended.

### PoC

### Mitigation

The following is the correct implementation.
```diff
    // expect that owners of the token will excempt from tax this contract
    function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
-       require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
-       tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
+       tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = difference;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
-       emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
+       emit Deposited(msg.sender, difference);
        return tokenID;
    }
```
