# `changeOwner()` does nothing

### Summary

The `changeOwner()` functions in `AuctionFactory.sol`, `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol`, and `buyOrderFactory.sol` do not change the `owner` state variable when called.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```

This function checks `msg.sender` against its argument instead of the `owner` state variable. It will always revert if used as intended, within the intended constraints.

### Impact

Instead of the deployer having a 6 hour window after deployment to call `changeOwner()` on `AuctionFactory.sol`, `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol`, and `buyOrderFactory.sol`, the function will not work at all.

If the circumstances of the deployment of these contracts necessitate a change of ownership, the contracts will have to be fixed and redeployed, and any fees spent on the original deployment will be lost.

### Mitigation

Ensure that the address passed to the function is different from the contract's state variable, like so:

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = newOwner;
    }
```
