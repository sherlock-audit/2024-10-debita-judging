# NFT buyer will never receive his receipt NFT after `buyOrder::sellNFT` function

### Summary

NFT buyer will never receive his receipt NFT after [`buyOrder::sellNFT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92C14-L141) function. This is a result of the absence of NFT transfer to the owner of the `buyOrder` as well as claiming mechanism. This will lead to straight up loss of funds for the user and unavailability to do anything with the received receipt NFT.

### Root Cause

Absence of transfer to the owner of the `buyOrder`

### Internal pre-conditions

User making a `buyOrder` and someone selling his receipt NFT to that `buyOrder`

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Loss of funds for the buyer and locked receipt NFT 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either transfer the receipt NFT to the buyer in the `buyOrder::sellNFT` function, or implement claiming mechanism for the buyer to claim it later
