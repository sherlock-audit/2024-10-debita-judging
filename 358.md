# NFTs Can Get Permanently Stuck in buyOrder Contract Due to Incorrect Transfer Destination



### Summary
The `buyOrder::sellNFT` function in buyOrder.sol transfers NFTs to the contract address (`address(this)`) instead of the buyer's address (`buyInformation.owner`), potentially leading to permanently stuck NFTs.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92

### Root Cause
The function incorrectly transfers veNFT tokens to the contract address instead of the intended buyer's address, creating a risk of NFT loss due to:
1. NFT stuck in contract instead to be transferred to buyer

### Internal pre-conditions
- Buy order must be active
- Available amount must be greater than 0
- Contract must have proper NFT handling capabilities

### External pre-conditions
- Seller must own the veNFT
- Seller must have approved the contract
- veNFT must exist and be transferable

### Attack Path
1. Seller calls `sellNFT` with valid receiptID
2. NFT gets transferred to contract address
3. Contract has no mechanism to transfer NFT to actual buyer
4. NFT becomes permanently stuck in contract
5. If contract self-destructs, NFT becomes permanently inaccessible

### Impact
- Permanent loss of valuable NFTs
- Users lose access to their veNFT tokens
- No recovery mechanism available
- Financial loss for users
- Platform reputation damage

### PoC
```javascript
function setUp() public {
    factory = new buyOrderFactory(address(new BuyOrder()));
    usdc = new ERC20Mock();
    veNFT = new MockVeNFR();

    buyer = address(1);
    seller = address(2);

    // Give buyer enough USDC (use BUY_AMOUNT constant)
    usdc.mint(buyer, BUY_AMOUNT);

    // Setup mock NFT
    veNFT.mint(seller, 123);

    console.log("=== Initial Setup ===");

    // 3. Seller approves and sells NFT
    vm.startPrank(seller);

    BuyOrder(buyOrder).sellNFT(123);

    uint256 expectedFee = (expectedAmount * factory.sellFee()) / 10000;
    assertEq(usdc.balanceOf(seller), expectedAmount - expectedFee);
    assertEq(usdc.balanceOf(factory.feeAddress()), expectedFee);

    console.log("\n=== Vulnerability Summary ===");
    console.log("1. NFT is permanently locked in contract");
    console.log("2. Buyer paid but received nothing");
    console.log("3. Seller got paid ");
    console.log("4. No recovery mechanism exists");

### Mitigation
```diff

function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
    require(buyInformation.isActive, "Buy order is not active");
    require(buyInformation.availableAmount > 0, "Buy order is not available");
    
    // Transfer NFT directly to buyer instead of contract
-   IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
-       msg.sender,
-       address(this),
-       receiptID
-   );
+   IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
+       msg.sender,
+       buyInformation.owner,
+       receiptID
+   );
    
    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```

Key changes:
1. Transfer NFT directly to buyer's address
2. Remove unnecessary contract holding of NFT
3. Ensure proper NFT delivery to intended recipient
