# DebitaChainlink does not check for staleness on chainlink pricefeed

### Summary

The DebitaChainlink contract does not check if the chainlink orice feed is stale

### Root Cause

In `DebitaChainlink::getThePrice` there is no check for the staleness of the price feed. All chainlink price feeds have a heartbeat(a window of time during which the price feed is considered valid) , prices older than the heartbeat are considered stale and should not be trusted.

   revert("stale price feed");
}
