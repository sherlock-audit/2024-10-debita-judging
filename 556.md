### Attack Path

Assuming that Alice creates a buy order to sell 1000 DAI (1000e18) in exchange for 2000 AERO (2000e18) at the ratio or price of `0.5 DAI per AERO`, which is equal to `5e17`.

1. The first person, Bob, owns a veAERO with 1000 AERO underlying. He sold his veAERO NFT to the buy order and recieved 500 DAI in turn. Bob's veAERO NFT is transferred into the buy order.
2. The second person, Charles, owns a veAERO with 1000 AERO underlying. He sold his veAERO NFT to the buy order and received 500 DAI in turn. Charles's veAERO NFT is transferred into the buy order.

At this point, Alice's buy order can be considered fulfilled as she has sold off all her 1000 DAI, and received 1000 worth of AER0 (via 2 x veAERO NFT). 2 x veAERO NFT reside within the Buy Order. 

However, the issue is that there is no feature that allows Alice to withdraw the veAERO NFT from the Buy Order. Thus, the veAERO NFTs are stuck in the buy order.
