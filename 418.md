# The `feeAddress` will never receive fees when users use token with higher price like ETH, BNB etc.

## Summary

When users use a token with higher price, majority of operations normally in small amount transaction. The fee calculation sometimes will be zero. So it's will affect to the `feeAddress` that it's never receive fees as expected.

## Vulnerability detail

When creating an Auction, a user can set a token for payment whatever they want. Logically, it's never impact to the protocol. But if we see at the codebase which calculating fee, it's possible to get zero amount. 
 Let's see code below : 
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L124
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L120-L121
 
The protocol calculating fee for any operation like auction and buy orders. Both of them perform calculations that lead a zero amount fee. There are conditions where fee would be zero. Let's say we have worst case with lowest `fee =  50` and the denominator always `10_000`. 
- Auction with 0.5% fees of token, the price must be higher than 200 tokens to avoid zero fee, 
- Buy orders with 0.5% fees of token, the price must be higher than 200 tokens to avoid zero fee.


## Poc

For the clear explanation, let's create an example : 
1. A user want to create an auction with value 60_000 USDC
2. But, a user uses  BNB token. Lets say current price is 600 USDC / BNB
3. So, the actual price is 60_000 USD / 600 -> 100 BNB
4. `feeAmount` = (amount on BNB * 50) / 10_000 -> (100 * 50)  / 10_000 -> 5_000 / 10_000 -> 0 of BNB
5. The final `feeAmount` is 0 BNB

## Recommendation

Consider to strict a token payment like stablecoin USDC to avoid this issue
