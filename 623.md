# Impossible to change ``AuctionFactory`` owner.

### Summary

The ``AuctionFactory::changeOwner`` function will fail silently when called, not updating the contract state.

### Root Cause

In [AuctionFactory::changeOwner(line222)]( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218C1-L222C4), the ``owner=owner`` statement will not change the state as the ``owner`` state variable will be "shadowed" by the function parameter. 

### Impact

Changing ownership of the contract will not be possible after contract deployment which could cause loss of funds for the protocol in an emergency case when a contract is compromised and ownership needs to be changed.

### Mitigation

Rename the function variable ``owner` of the ``changeOwner`` function to ``_owner`` so the state is correctly saved and ownerships can be changed.
