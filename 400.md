# `perpetual` oan offers cannot be repaid after second matching

### Summary

When a borrower calls `payDebt()`, if the `lendOffer` is a `perpetual` loan, the funds are returned to the `lendOffer` contract .
Since anyone can call `matchOffersV3()` the `lendOffer` can be matched again with another BorrowOffer.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L232-L237

The problem is that if the `principle is USDT, when the borrower calls `payDebt()` a second time the call will revert because during the first repayment a non zero amount was approved and USDT does not work when changing allowance form an existing non-zero value without first approving a zero value

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Loan.sol
233:             if (lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer) {
234:                 loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
235:   @>            IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);
236:                 lendOffer.addFunds(total); 

```

### Attack Path



### Impact

Borrowers cannot repay their loans and are forced into liquidation

### PoC

- Alice borrowOfer is matched with Bob's lendOffer for a principle amount of 1200 USDT
- Alice repays her debt and the funds are returned to Bobs lendOffer contract
- Bobs lendOffer is now matched with Carols borrowOffer.
- Carol calls `payDebt()` but the call reverts

### Mitigation

implement a safe means of approval after the funds have been successfully added to the `lendOffer` contract
