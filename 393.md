# Vulnerability in `DLOFactory::deleteOrder()` allows owner of `DLOImplementation` to decrease `activeOrdersCount` as much they want.

### Summary

Missing proper checks in the `DLOFactory::deleteOrder()` function allow the owner of `DLOImplementation` to manipulate `activeOrdersCount`. This could lead to overwriting new `DLOImplementation` contracts deployed over previously deployed ones by tampering with `activeOrdersCount`. Additionally, it enables nullifying the `DLOImplementation` at index `activeOrdersCount = 0` .

### Root Cause

Missing proper checks for the Deleted order in the function `DLOFactory::deleteOrder()`

### Internal pre-conditions

NA

### External pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. The owner of the `DLOImplementation` contract calls the `DLOImplementation::cancelOffer()` function, which internally calls the `DLOFactory::deleteOrder()` function, resulting in the order being deleted from the `DLOFactory`.

2. The owner then calls the `DLOImplementation::addFunds()` function, successfully depositing funds without any issue, enabling them to call the `DLOImplementation::cancelOffer()` function again.

3. The owner calls `DLOImplementation::cancelOffer()`, triggering the `DLOFactory::deleteOrder()` function. This causes the deletion of the order at index 0 and decrements `activeOrdersCount` . This repetitive process can disrupt the protocol's core functionality by improperly manipulating the `activeOrdersCount` and impacting order management integrity.

### Impact

The vulnerability allows malicious manipulation of `activeOrdersCount`, disrupting order tracking, enabling overwriting of contracts, and compromising the protocol's core functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add some more checks in the function  `DLOFactory::deleteOrder()`
