# External transfer calls without success checks in cancelOffer function

The cancelOffer function does not validate the success of external calls when transferring collateral back to the owner. This oversight could result in the loss of collateral or an inconsistent contract state if a transfer fails.

### Root Cause

The function executes external calls (IERC721.transferFrom or SafeERC20.safeTransfer) without verifying their success. State variables like borrowInformation.availableAmount and isActive are updated regardless of whether the transfer succeeds.

### Internal pre-conditions

State variables (borrowInformation.availableAmount and isActive) are modified before confirming the success of the collateral transfer.
The function lacks checks to validate whether IERC721.transferFrom or SafeERC20.safeTransfer succeeds.

### External pre-conditions

External transfer may fail due to:
- Insufficient balance or approval for ERC-20/ERC-721 tokens.
- Token contract-level restrictions (e.g., transfer paused).
- Malfunctions in the underlying token contracts.

### Attack Path

1) A user invokes cancelOffer.
2) The contract attempts to transfer the collateral back to the owner.
3) The transfer call fails silently, leaving the collateral stuck in the contract.
4) State variables (borrowInformation.availableAmount set to 0) incorrectly reflect that the collateral has been successfully transferred, preventing recovery attempts.

### Impact

- Loss of Collateral: Owners may permanently lose access to collateral if the transfer fails.
- State Inconsistency: Contract state reflects the successful transfer of collateral even when it has failed, disrupting subsequent operations.

### Mitigation

Validate External Call Success: Add explicit checks to confirm the success of the transfer. For example: 
bool success = SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
    IERC20(m_borrowInformation.collateral), msg.sender, availableAmount
);  
require(success, "ERC-20 transfer failed");   

Similarly for the NFT external transfer call.
