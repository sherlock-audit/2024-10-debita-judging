# DebitaIncentives.sol: Insufficient constraint in `deprecatePrinciple()` function

### Summary

The contract contains a vulnerability where a deprecated principle can still be used in the` updateFunds()`  function. This occurs because updateFunds only validates the pair (principle and collateral) using isPairWhitelisted but does not check if the principle itself is still active and the `depricatePrinciple()` function only sets the principle's whitelist state to false but not it's pairs.
