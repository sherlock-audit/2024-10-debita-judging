# `AuctionFactory`'s `changeOwner` is completely broken

### Summary

Ever since the `owner` is set during the `AuctionFactory`'s contract construction, it can never be changed due to not using a locally-scoped `_owner` variable as an argument in the `changeOwner` function.

### Root Cause

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218-L221

```solidity
// file: AuctionFactory.sol

    // ...

    uint public publicAuctionFee = 50; // fee for public auctions 0.5%
    uint deployedTime;
    address owner; // owner of the contract

    // ...

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        feeAddress = msg.sender;
        deployedTime = block.timestamp;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner");
        _;
    }
```
```solidity
// file: AuctionFactory.sol

    // ...

    function setFeeAddress(address _feeAddress) public onlyOwner {
        feeAddress = _feeAddress;
    }

    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
     @@ owner = owner; // @ <=== here is the problem
    }

    function emitAuctionDeleted(
        address _auctionAddress,
        address creator
    ) public onlyAuctions {
        emit auctionEnded(_auctionAddress, creator);
    }
```

As you can see here, the `owner` variable in the `changeOwner` function's agruments "shadows" the global `owner` variable in the storage.

### Hence:
1. The comparison `owner == msg.sender` is absolutely wrong;
2. The global `owner` function can never be updated because the `owner = owner` assignment just updates the local `calldata` `owner` variable's value, and never touches the `owner` that was declated in the `AuctionFactory`'s real storage.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

The current `owner` address of the `AuctionFactory` contract intends to update the `owner`, setting it to another address, via calling the `changeOwner` function.

### Attack Path

Whenever `changeOwner` is called, it will likely just revert as the `owner` passed in the arguments will barely ever be the `msg.sender` (otherwise there'd be no sense in calling `changeOwner`).

In any case, `changeOwner` will either revert on the check (in 99,99% of the cases), or as long as `owner` (which is supposed to be the "`newOwner`" or `_owner` in this context to locally scope it) just update the locally-scoped `owner` variable (i.e. itself!).

### Impact

There's no way to update the current `AuctionFactory`'s `owner`: the only way is through via `changeOwner`, which is completely broken due to referring to a locally-scoped `owner` variable (its own argument!), and shadowing the globally-scoped `owner` due to the same naming of the variable.


***In other words, `changeOwner` is essentially a view-only pure function due to that aforementioned mistake.***

### PoC

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```

### Mitigation

```diff
-   function changeOwner(address owner) public {
+   function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
-       owner = owner;
+       owner = _owner;
    }
```
