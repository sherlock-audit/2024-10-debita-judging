# Incorrect Deletion Patterns Lead to Data Corruption and Potential Exploitation Across Multiple Contracts

### Summary

The Debita v3 protocol exhibits improper deletion patterns in several factory contracts. When removing the last element from arrays tracking active entities (such as auctions, buy orders, borrow offers, and lend offers), the contracts incorrectly update internal mappings. This mismanagement results in assigning valid indices to `address(0)`, corrupting the internal state. Consequently, when new entities are added, index duplication occurs, leading to inconsistencies between arrays and mappings. This data corruption can cause severe operational failures, inaccurate data representation on the frontend, and potential security vulnerabilities due to the inconsistent state.

### Root Cause

In multiple factory contracts, the deletion functions for various entities incorrectly handle the removal of the last element in their respective arrays. When the last element is deleted:
- The function attempts to swap it with the last element (which is itself) and sets the last array slot to `address(0)`.
- The mapping that tracks indices is then updated, inadvertently assigning a valid index to `address(0)`.
- This results in `address(0)` holding a valid index in the mapping, corrupting the data structure.

This incorrect deletion pattern is present in the following contracts:

- [`AuctionFactory`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L145)
- [`buyOrderFactory`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L127)
- [`DebitaBorrowOfferFactory`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L162)
- [`DebitaLendOfferFactory`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207)

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Deletion of Last Element:
- An entity (e.g., an auction) calls its deletion function to remove itself from the active list.
- Being the last element, its index equals the count minus one.

2. Incorrect Mapping Update:

- The function assigns address(0) to the array at the deleted index.
- The index mapping is updated, assigning the deleted index to address(0).

3. Corruption of Mappings:

- address(0) now holds a valid index in the mapping.
- When a new entity is added, it may receive the same index, causing duplication.

4. Resulting Issues:
- Functions that rely on accurate mappings may fail or produce incorrect results.
- Frontend displays incorrect data or fails to display new entities.
- An attacker could exploit this inconsistency to interfere with contract operations.


### Impact

- **Data Integrity Violation:** The mappings lose their integrity due to duplicate indices and incorrect associations, leading to unreliable data.
- **Operational Failures:** Frontend applications and contract functions that rely on these mappings may malfunction, causing errors for users and disrupting normal operations.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Malicious actors could exploit the corrupted state to perform unauthorized actions, manipulate data, cause denial-of-service conditions, or misrepresent the contract state.

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, the deletion functions in all affected contracts should be corrected to properly handle element removal:

**Adjust Deletion Logic:**
- Decrease the count of active elements before performing operations that rely on it.
- Only swap and update the mapping if the deleted element is not the last one.
- Ensure that address(0) is not assigned a valid index in the mapping.

**Maintain Consistency:**
- After deletion, confirm that the array and mapping accurately represent the current state.
- Prevent index duplication by correctly managing indices during deletion and addition of entities.

By implementing these changes, the contracts will maintain data integrity, prevent operational failures, and eliminate potential security vulnerabilities arising from corrupted mappings.
