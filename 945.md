# Malicious lendOrder can delete all orders

### Summary

`DLOFactory::deleteOrder` can be called idefinitely by a lendOrder to delete all orders


### Root Cause

In [`DLOFactory::deleteOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207-L220) the function can be called by a lendOrder to delete itself, However, a malicious lendOrder can also delete other orders by calling the same function over and over again. This is possible due tot the following reasons

- LendOrders are zero indexed (i.e the first lendOrder is at `allActiveLendOrders[0]` & `LendOrderIndex[firstOrder] = 0`) so setting the index to 0 (as is done in the `deleteOrder` function) does not actually delete the order
- There's no check if the order is already deleted
- The lendOrder can call `DLOFactory::deleteOrder` as long as `availableAmount > 0` and because the lendOrder owner can always increase the availabe amount via the `addFunds` function , `deleteOrder` can be called indefinitely

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates a lendOrder bt calling the lendOrder factory `createLendOrder` function with a `startLendingAmount` of 1 wei
2. Attacker calls `DLOImplementation::cancelOffer` -> `DLOFactory::deleteOrder` to delete the order
- The `LendOrderIndex[lendOrder]` is set to 0
- The last order (at `index == activeOrdersCount - 1`) is moved to the previous index of the deleted order
- The `activeOrdersCount` is decreased by 1 
3. The attacker calls `DLOImplementation::addFunds` to increase the `availableAmount` of the deleted order
4. Repeats 2 - 3 indefinitely, but each time the last order is now moved to `index == 0`(which is the index of the deleted order) and the `activeOrdersCount` is decreased


### Impact

High - Attacker can delete all orders

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. LendOrder indexing should begin from 1
2. Check if lendOrder is already deleted (i.e. if its index is 0) before deleting it
