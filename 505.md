# Malicious use of erc20 tokens as incentives in DebitaIncentives.sol

### Summary

No check on return value of [`transferFrom`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L269) and the also not checking the difference between previous and  new balance of address(this) after [`transferFrom`  in `incentivizePair :: DebitaIncentives`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L269) could lead to state inconsistency and thereby negatively affecting users incentives when some erc20 tokens are used maliciously used 

### Root Cause

1. A missing check on [`transferFrom`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L269). A malicious user could incentivize a pair in [`incentivizePair`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L225C14-L225C29) with a token(e.g USDT) which does not revert but fails silently (due to allowance issues, insufficient balances, etc) since the return value is not properly checked, it could appear to succeed leading to increase in some state variables ( [`lentIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L278), [`borrowedIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L282)) which in turn affects the claim of users' incentives as the balance of the contract as been maliciously increased
2. Lack of check of the difference between previous balance before `transferFrom`  and after.
A malicious user could use a token (e.g., cUSDCv3) which contains a special case for amount == type(uint256).max in their transfer functions that results in only the malicious user's balance being transferred. This would increase the variables ( [`lentIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L278), [`borrowedIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L282)) luring other users to interact with the given principles and the end of the day users will not be able to claim incentives as the amount used by the malicious user is not the amount transfered.

### Impact

1. DOS in users' incentives
2. State inconsistency of mapping variables


### Mitigation

Checking the difference of the amount before and after [`transferFrom`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L269)
