# Wrong fee percentage for loan extension period

### Summary

The timestamp of the max deadline is used when calculating the fee percentage for the maximum loan duration.

As a result of the incorrect value being used, when a borrower extends a loan, he will be charged a higher fee (max fee), in the cases where the fee percentage for the initial duration is not equal to the max fee percentage.

Example:
Say initial loan duration is 5 days and max duration is 10 days.
Fee percentage for the initial duration of the loan is `5 * 0.04% = 0.2%`.
User extends the loan. The fee percentage that should be applied for the additional 5 days should be equal to `5 * 0.04 = 0.2%`.
Instead, since the max fee is applied, the user will be charged 0.6% for the extension period.

```solidity
uint PorcentageOfFeePaid = ((m_loan.initialDuration * feePerDay) / 86400);
```
...
```solidity
if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
   // calculate difference from fee paid for the initialDuration vs the extra fee they should pay because of the extras days of extending the loan.  MAXFEE shouldnt be higher than extra fee + PorcentageOfFeePaid
   uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) / 86400);
   if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
       feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
   } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) {
       feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
   }

    misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
}
```

`misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;`

If feeOfMaxDeadline was calculated correctly, _missingBorrowFee_ would be equal to `(10 * 0.04) - (5 * 0.04) = 0.2%`
Instead, since max fee is applied for the extension, _missingBorrowFee_ would be equal to `0.8 - (5 * 0.04) = 0.6%`

### Root Cause

In DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3() ([DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:511](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L511)) the value passed to _maxDeadline_ is `lendInfo.maxDuration + block.timestamp` i.e. this will be a large number indicating a timestamp, instead of a duration period.

In DebitaV3Loan::extendLoan() ([DebitaV3Loan.sol:602](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L602)) the _maxDeadline_ is used for calculating the value of _feeOfMaxDeadline_. The value that should be used for this calculation is the max duration of the loan, but _maxDeadline_ does not represent that.

As a result, _feeOfMaxDeadline_ will be equal to the maximum fee percentage in cases where it should be lower.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Existing loan

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users will be charged higher fees for the extension period than the fees agreed to in the loan.
In the worst case scenario (initial duration = 1 day, maxDuration = 2 days), the borrower will be charged 0.76% instead of 0.04% for the extension period.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A new field holding the max duration should be added to the _infoOfOffers_ struct ([DebitaV3Loan.sol:91](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L91)) and it should be used for the calculation of the fee percentage for the max loan duration instead of _maxDeadline_.

It's recommended to set the max duration for each accepted offer at the point of loan creation, as getting it dynamically from the lend order contract does not guarantee immutability.
