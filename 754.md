# User might lose funds because safeTransfer isn't used in Incentives

### Summary

The missing check for return values in incentives contract might cause [loss of funds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L203) for user.


```solidity
function claimIncentives(
        address[] memory principles,
        address[][] memory tokensIncentives,
        uint epoch
    ) public {
.
IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amountToClaim);
.
}
```


### Root Cause

The token may return false on attempts to claim for the user which causes loss of funds, however the usual way of mitigating it through safeTransfer isn't used in `claimIncentives` method.
