# `changePerpetual()` may underflow `activeOrdersCount`

### Summary

`changePerpetual()` is when we want to change the `perpetual` boolean of our lending offer.

The issue stems from passing `_perpetual` to false N number of times to underflow the `activeOrdersCount` variable in the factory contract, thus making it impossible for other lending offers to be matched or cancelled.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the entire function itself - it should either not exist at all or make it such that we can change it only once from perpetual to a non-perpetual and that's it, no toggling on and off.

This brings up the possibility of calling it with passing `_perpetual` set to `false` every single time and underflow `activeOrdersCount` due to the `deleteOrder()` invocation and this will lead to offers being **unable to be matched or cancelled**, thus ruining the integrity of the protocol.

Perpetual lending offers call the `deleteOrder()` when `_perpetual` is false and we have no `availableAmount`.

This brings up the possibility of creating both the borrowing and the lending offer (a perpetual one so we do not get `isActive` to false in `acceptLendingOffer()`), matching it and paying minimal fee and then spamming the `changePerpetual()` with `_perpetual` to false, so we underflow it totally and ruin the integrity as I pointed out in the first paragraph.

### Internal pre-conditions

In my scenario, we need to be both the lender and the borrower + set the lending offer to being perpetual due to it not being cancelled in [acceptLendingOffer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L128-L131)

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `Alice` creates a borrowing offer
2. `Alice` creates a lending offer that is perpetual
3. `Alice` matches her lending and borrowing offer, she only pays minimal fee to Debita (0.17% after we subtract the ConnectorFee)
4. `Alice` then calls `changePerpetual()` - `isActive` is NOT `false` as I showed in the internal conditions and then passing `_perpetual` param as `false` and spamming it till `activeOrdersCount` is `0`
5. `Bob` gets his lending offer fully matched, but the `acceptLendingOffer()` reverts when it tries to call `deleteOrder()` due to the `activeOrdersCount` being already set to `0`

### Impact

Lending offers can't be matched and cancelled, rendering the protocol useless with funds being stucked.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I would advice to make it impossible to change the perpetual, once a perpetual, always a perpetual or make the logic such that you can change it once from perpetual to a non-perpetual and that's it for the entire lending offer.
