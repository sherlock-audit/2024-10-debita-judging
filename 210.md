# Attacker Can Empty Active Lend Offer List.

### Summary

An attacker can exploit the `DebitaLendOfferFactory::deleteOrder` function to repeatedly delete lend offers from the active lend offer list, eventually emptying the list.

### Root Cause

- Flawed Assumption in [DebitaLendOfferFactory::deleteOrder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207):
The `deleteOrder()` function assumes it will not be called multiple times for the same lend offer. However, this assumption is incorrect.
- Lack of `isActive` Check in `DLOImplementation`:
The [DLOImplementation::addFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162-L176) and [DLOImplementation::cancelOffer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L109-L139) functions fail to verify the `isActive` state variable, allowing operations on deleted lend offers.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates a lend offer, which is then fully matched with a borrow offer. The `isActive` flag is set to `true`, and `lendInformation.availableAmount` becomes zero.
2. The attacker calls `DLOImplementation::addFunds()` on the deleted lend offer, increasing `lendInformation.availableAmount` to a nonzero value. Since `addFunds()` does not check `isActive`, this action is allowed.
3. The attacker calls `DLOImplementation::cancelOffer()` on the lend offer to delete it again. The transaction succeeds because `lendInformation.availableAmount` is nonzero, passing the check:
```solidity
    require(availableAmount > 0, "No funds to cancel");
```
4. This action triggers `DebitaLendOfferFactory::deleteOrder()` for the previously deleted lend offer `_lendOrder`:
    1. Since `_lendOrder` is already deleted, `index = 0` is retrieved:
    ```solidity
        uint index = LendOrderIndex[_lendOrder];
    ```
    2. The first lend offer in the list is overwritten by the last one:
    ```solidity
        // switch index of the last borrow order to the deleted borrow order
        allActiveLendOrders[index] = allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1];
        LendOrderIndex[allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1]] = index;
    ```
    3. The last entry is then deleted, reducing the list's length:
    ```solidity
        allActiveLendOrders[activeOrdersCount - 1] = address(0);

        activeOrdersCount--;
    ``` 
5. By repeating these steps, the attacker can empty the entire active lend offer list, rendering the lending system unusable.


### Impact

The attacker can empty the active lend offer list, effectively shutting down the lending system.

### Mitigation

1. Add the following into the `DebitaLendOfferFactory::deleteOrder()` function:
```solidity
    require(isLendOrderLegit[_lendOrder], "Already deleted");
    isLendOrderLegit[_lendOrder] = false;
```
2. Add the following check into the `DLOImplementation::addFunds()` and `DLOImplementation::cancelOffer()` functions.
```solidity
    require(isActive, "Offer is not active");
```
