# Accumulated rounding down in weighted apr calculation may force borrower accept offers that he not accept in other cases

### Summary

The `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3` function passes lendOrders[] as a function argument. In what order the lend orders are arranged in this list is decided only by the transaction initiator.

However, this order matters. Let's understand that the only APR check that is performed when ordering match is the following and it is located in [this line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L560).
```solidity
require(weightedAverageAPR[i] <= borrowInfo.maxApr, "Invalid APR");
```
Let's understand how weighteAverageAPR is calculated for each principle.

```solidity
 for (uint i = 0; i < lendOrders.length; i++) {
    ....
    uint principleIndex = indexPrinciple_LendOrder[i];
....
    uint updatedLastApr = (weightedAverageAPR[principleIndex] *
                amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex]) /
                (amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex] + lendAmountPerOrder[i]);

    uint newWeightedAPR = (lendInfo.apr * lendAmountPerOrder[i]) /
                amountPerPrinciple[principleIndex];

    weightedAverageAPR[principleIndex] =
                newWeightedAPR +
                updatedLastApr;
```

So, now let's show that the order in which the orders were transferred - affects the counting. To make it easier to understand, I have written two simple scripts in python. They show how weighted APR changes depending on the order in which lend orders are processed (the changes are due to different rounding during processing)

For the sake of clarity I chose the following case. Suppose we have 100 lend orders in lend orders of which 1 for 1000 tokens with APR = 10,000 (100%) and 99 others for 10 tokens with apr = 100 (1%).

Let's analyse two cases - when the order for 1000 tokens is the first in the list and when it is the last.

```python
bigdep = 1000 * 10 ** 18
smalldep = 10 * 10 ** 18

bigapr = 10000
smallapr = 100


# 1 case [1000, 10, 10 .... 10]

updatedLastApr = 0

newWeightedApr = bigapr * bigdep // bigdep

weightedAverageApr = newWeightedApr + updatedLastApr

amountPerPrinciple = bigdep


for i in range(99):
   updatedLastApr = (weightedAverageApr * amountPerPrinciple) // (amountPerPrinciple + smalldep)
   amountPerPrinciple += smalldep
   newWeightedApr = (smallapr * smalldep) // amountPerPrinciple
   weightedAverageApr = newWeightedApr + updatedLastApr

print(weightedAverageApr) #4987
```

```python
bigdep = 1000 * 10 ** 18
smalldep = 10 * 10 ** 18

bigapr = 10000
smallapr = 100


# 2 case [10, 10, 10 .... 1000]

amountPerPrinciple = smalldep

for i in range(99):
   updatedLastApr = (weightedAverageApr * amountPerPrinciple) // (amountPerPrinciple + smalldep)
   amountPerPrinciple += smalldep
   newWeightedApr = (smallapr * smalldep) // amountPerPrinciple
   weightedAverageApr = newWeightedApr + updatedLastApr
   
updatedLastApr = (weightedAverageApr * amountPerPrinciple) // (amountPerPrinciple + bigdep)
amountPerPrinciple += bigdep
newWeightedApr = (bigapr * bigdep) // amountPerPrinciple
weightedAverageApr = newWeightedApr + updatedLastApr

print(weightedAverageApr) #5052
```

We see that in the first case weightedApr = 4987 and in the second case it is #5052. Thus, it is possible to manipulate the size of weightedApr and force the borrowe to accept debts it should not accept.


### Root Cause

The only check for acceptable apr is to compare borrower.maxApr to weightedApr, but  weightedApr can be manipulated by any party.

Moreover, the use of weightedApr may force the borrower to borrow at a very high interest rate for a large amount, just because weightedAPR can be lowered with dust lend orders.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Any entity can match orders. Including lenders themselves can do it. 

### Attack Path

Lender wants his loan with apr to be accepted, but his apr is greater than borrower's maxApr.

He creates dust orders, or simply looks for other lend orders and combines them in the final array so that weightedApr is lower than maxApr.

### Impact

Clearly the borrower is deceived when orders that he should not have accepted turn out to be accepted because the lend orders have been rearranged. Thus, it is possible to almost completely ignore borrower.maxApr  

High severity - broken key functional of protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I think maxApr should be greater than the apr of each individual lendOrder.
