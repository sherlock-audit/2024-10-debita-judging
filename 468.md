# Pyth Oracle's returned Price's Confidence is Ignored

### Summary

The missing validation of the `confidence` parameter returned by the Pyth Price Feeds may cause the protocol to mismatch borrowers and lenders which could lead to loss of funds. Attackers might take advantage of the wrong prices to create loans that trap honest users. 

Even though the README suggests `If there is a difference greater than 5%, the oracle will be paused until it stabilizes again`, any price deviation up to `±4.9%` will also incur substantial losses to users in the protocol. 

### Root Cause

The prices fetched by the Pyth Oracle comes with a degree of uncertainty. The [official documentation of Pyth Price Feeds](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/best-practices#confidence-intervals) recommend that these confidence values be used to increase the overall security of the protocol. 

In the Debita protocol, [`DebitaPyth::getThePrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaPyth.sol#L32) completely ignores the confidence. The confidence needs to be used by the protocol to ensure that the price feeds are not used by attackers to take advantage of the `matchOffersV3` function to match borrowers with lenders.

### Impact

Wrong prices will cause the protocol to mismatch borrowers and lenders. It will also give rise to a scenario where attackers will use the invalid price deviation up to `±4.9%` to create loan traps for honest users to steal their funds.
