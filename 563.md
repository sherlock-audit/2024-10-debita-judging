### Attack Path

The following is the extract from the [contest's README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3-xiaoming9090?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate):

> Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?

Thus, Fee-on-Transfer (FOT) tokens are supported within the protocol as long as it is wrapped within the `TaxTokensReceipt contract`.

Assume that Alice has 100 FOT tokens that she wants to lend out. To use FOT within Debita, she calls the `TaxTokensReceipts.execute` function to deposit her 100 FOT, and a `TaxTokensReceipts` receipt NFT with 100 FOT locked amount will be minted to Alice to be used within Debita.

Next, Alice calls the `DLOFactory.createLendOrder` function to create a lend order to lend out her 100 FOT tokens.

However, the issue is that the function does not accept her `TaxTokensReceipts` receipt NFT with 100 FOT locked amount because it only uses `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` function. Thus, the `DebitaLendOfferFactory.createLendOrder` function is considered broken as it cannot support FOT while it is supposed to.

```solidity

..SNIP..
177:         SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
178:             IERC20(_principle),
179:             msg.sender,
180:             address(lendOffer),
181:             _startedLendingAmount
182:         );
183: 
184:         uint balance = IERC20(_principle).balanceOf(address(lendOffer));
185:         require(balance >= _startedLendingAmount, "Transfer failed");
```

### Impact

Medium. Breaks core contract functionality since the protocol is designed to support FOT by wrapping it within the `TaxTokensReceipt`. However, due to this bug, FOT cannot be used within lend order.
