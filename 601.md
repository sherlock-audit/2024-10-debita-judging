# Malicious actor can DoS the whole lending functionality resulting in all lending offers being stucked

### Summary

Alice decides to do bad things today as she notices a vulnerability in the `DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol`.

She has a lending offer which is not yet matched, but decides to cancel it via `cancelOffer()` purposefully - **cancellation doesn't remove the actual contract that is having the lending offer**, just changes some variables in the factory contract,
and decrements the `activeOrdersCount`.

She is then totally free to call `addFunds()` to add funds to her lend offer that was just deleted, but it actually just had it funds emptied and decremented `activeOrdersCount`, or said with other words - she can freely interact with it.

There is a variable called `isActive`, which is set to `false`, but nowhere in `addFunds()` or `cancelOrder()` is it being checked, so it is not enforced, even thought it should.

After Alice adds funds via `addFunds()`, she can call `cancelOrder()` a second time and again decrement `activeOrdersCount`.

She can do that repeatedly till `activeOrdersCount` is equal to zero, even though numerous lending offers can exist, and they will most likely!

This results in an underflow that will make cancellation of other users' lending offers impossible and breaking `acceptLendingOffer()` as well, because it is a function that still tries to call `deleteOrder()` to the factory contract, **which will render both cancellation and accepting of lending offers impossible** in the contract, resulting in stuck funds.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the lack of a logic that checks `isActive` boolean in `cancelOrder()` and `addFunds()`- I do not see any reason why it is set in cancelOrder() but not enforced in the functions that I mentioned.

We can see that it is being set to [false](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L149) in cancelOrder(), but not checked against, so we can call cancelOrder() as much times as we want if we have funds in `availableAmount` in order to decrement till underflow is possible - leading to the impossibility of legitimate users cancelling orders as well as having their orders matched.

All in all, calling those two functions should come up with a check in the beginning of the function that is require(isActive) to see if the lending offer is still active.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates a lending offer via the factory contract
2. Alice calls `cancelOffer()` and get her initial tokens that she sent when she created the lending offer
3. Alice then calls `addFunds()` to be able to invoke `cancelOffer()` again
4. She repeats calling `addFunds()` and then `cancelOffer()` till she decrements the `activeOrdersCount` to 0
5. Bob has his lending offer matched, but `acceptLendingOffer()` calls at the of it `deleteOrder()`, which will try to do: 0 - 1, which as we know in Solidity is an underflow and will result in a revert.

### Impact

Lending offers can't be accepted and matched and lending offers can't be cancelled.

Basically any function which calls `deleteOrder()` will be uncallable, resulting in breaking core protocol logic and resulting in a 100% loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement `isActive` checks in the functions that are needed - `addFunds()` and `cancelOffer()`
