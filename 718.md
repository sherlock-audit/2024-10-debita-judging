# Ownerships::tokenURI() may return incorrect data and does not adhere to ERC-721

### Summary

According to [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721#specification) `tokenURI()` must revert when called with a non-existent `tokenId`.
In the Ownerships contract this requirement is not kept leading to a violation of the ERC-721 specification.

Going further, the `tokenURI()` method of Ownerships contract can return incorrect metadata - both the type of the loan and the address in the image might be incorrect.

This can lead to a poor user experience or financial loss for users who were deceived by the metadata information for the NFT.

### Root Cause

- In [DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol:81](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol#L81) there is a require statement which ensures that the `tokenId` is less than or equal to the current highest `tokenId`. 
This check does not account for cases where a `tokenId` was burned and should be considered non-existent.

- The response metadata contains an image that contains information about the loan - the type of the loan and the loan address.
  - The loan type is assigned a value of either "Borrower" or "Lender" based on whether the tokenId is an even number.
  
    Relying on the order of minting to determine whether the tokenId corresponds to the borrower or lender in the loan is flawed. 
  
    The logic for minting can be found in [DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:503](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L502)(lender) and [DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:577](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L577)(borrower). 
  First the ownerships are minted for all of the lenders, the number of which can vary, followed by the ownership for the borrower. Since there can be an arbitrary amount of lend orders, we cannot rely on the `tokenId` being an even/odd number for determining whether the ownership represents the lender or the borrower.
  
  - The loan address's value is taken from DebitaV3Aggregator::getAddressById() ([DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol:83](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol#L83)) by passing the `tokenId` as the function argument. 
  
    The issue is that there are no ownerships minted for loans, meaning there is no relation between the `tokenId` and loan id. As a result this might return address 0 or an arbitrary loan's address which is not connected to this ownership in any way.


### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

By invoking the `tokenURI()` method with a non-existent tokenId the method will return data for what appears to be a genuine Ownerships NFT.

Even when` tokenURI()` is called with an existing `tokenId` the type of the loan and the loan address can be incorrect.

The returned metadata from `tokenURI()` may deceive users

Apart from returning incorrect data, another likely negative effect is integration problems with NFT marketplaces.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

ERC-721 [_exists](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_exists-uint256-) can be used for verifying whether the `tokenId` exists.
