# TaxTokensReceipt does not work with fee-on-transfer token

### Summary

The balance check in TaxTokensReceipt:deposit will block fee-on-transfer token's deposit.

### Root Cause

In Readme, `Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in TaxTokensReceipt contract`. So the TaxTokensReceipt should support fee-on-transfer token.
In [TaxTokensReceipt:deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L69), we have one balance check.
This balance check will make sure that actual received balance cannot be less than the transferred amount. But the problem is that actual received balance will be less than the transferred amount for fee-on-transfer token. This will cause the deposit revert.
```solidity
    function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        // Here we make sure that the actual amount should not be less than amount.
@>        require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        ...
    }
```

### Impact

TaxTokensReceipts cannot work with fee-on-transfer token. This breaks the expected behaviour.

### Mitigation

Remove the improper check for fee-on-transfer token. And update `tokenAmountPerID[tokenID]` with the actual received balance `difference` not `amount`.
