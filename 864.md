# a malicious user can create multiple loan with very small amounts and bloat the contract

### Summary

while matching orders the aggregator contract check if the lend length is less than or equal to 100

        require(lendOrders.length <= 100, "Too many lend orders");

This line is a requirement check to ensure that the number of lend orders passed into the function does not exceed a certain limit
The function is designed to handle a maximum of 100 lend orders at a time to prevent gas limits from being exceeded. If there are more than 100 lend orders, the transaction would fail and revert however a malicious user can create many loan orders with very small amount and bloat the contract leading to potential dos when users create orders there is no minimum check and fee for creating a order the user will execute this attack without anything at stake
