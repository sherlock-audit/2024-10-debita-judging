# Duplication of struct name causes `DebitaLendOfferFactory::getActiveOrders` to revert every time it is called with the wrong struct as the datatype.

### Summary

2 similar structs `LendInfo` defined in [`DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L8) and [`DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L26) might cause the function `getActiveOrders` to revert every single time if the incorrect struct is used as the return datatype. This will cause the users to not get the updates they need to make decisions on the platform. 

### Root Cause

The function [`getActiveOrders`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L222) returns `DLOImplementation.LendInfo[] memory` which is the `LendInfo` struct defined in the `DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol` file. When a user calls the `getActiveOrders` function, they will need to double-check that they are using the correct struct. If they use the incorrect struct, they will be introduced to the following very confusing error: 

`Type struct DLOImplementation.LendInfo[] memory is not implicitly convertible to expected type struct DLOImplementation.LendInfo[] memory.`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users using the wrong struct to call the function might cause them to miss out and probably lose out on good investments because of the confusing nature of the smart contract. 

### PoC

Add the following test in `Debita-V3-Contracts/test/local/Aggregator/BasicDebitaAggregator.t.sol`. 

```solidity
function test_checking_LendInfo() public { 
        DLOImplementation.LendInfo[] memory active_lend_orders; 
        active_lend_orders = DLOFactoryContract.getActiveOrders(0, 100); 
        }
```

Run the test with `forge test --mt test_checking_LendInfo -vvv`. 
It will revert with the error: 

`Type struct DLOImplementation.LendInfo[] memory is not implicitly convertible to expected type struct DLOImplementation.LendInfo[] memory.`

To make sure that it works add the following into the beginning of `Debita-V3-Contracts/test/local/Aggregator/BasicDebitaAggregator.t.sol`: 

```solidity
import {DLOImplementation as DLOImplementation2} from "@contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol";
```

Now, replace the code with: 

```solidity
function test_checking_LendInfo() public { 
        DLOImplementation2.LendInfo[] memory active_lend_orders; 
        active_lend_orders = DLOFactoryContract.getActiveOrders(0, 100); 
    }
```

Now the function works. The fact that there is a contract, and an interface with the same name that causes reverts if the imports are mixed up will cause a lot of problems in the deployment, as well as future maintenance of the code. 

### Mitigation

The easiest way to mitigate this function is to do the following in `Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol`: 

```diff
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol";
import "@contracts/DebitaProxyContract.sol";
+import "@contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol"; 

-interface DLOImplementation {
-    struct LendInfo {
-        address lendOrderAddress;
-        bool perpetual;
-        bool lonelyLender;
-        bool[] oraclesPerPairActivated;
-        uint[] maxLTVs;
-        uint apr;
-        uint maxDuration;
-        uint minDuration;
-        address owner;
-        address principle;
-        address[] acceptedCollaterals;
-        address[] oracle_Collaterals;
-        uint[] maxRatio;
-        address oracle_Principle;
-        uint startedLendingAmount;
-        uint availableAmount;
-    }
-
-    function getLendInfo() external view returns (LendInfo memory);
-    function isActive() external view returns (bool);
-
-    function initialize(
-        address _aggregatorContract,
-        bool _perpetual,
-        bool[] memory _oraclesActivated,
-        bool _lonelyLender,
-        uint[] memory _LTVs,
-        uint _apr,
-        uint _maxDuration,
-        uint _minDuration,
-        address _owner,
-        address _principle,
-        address[] memory _acceptedCollaterals,
-        address[] memory _oracles_Collateral,
-        uint[] memory _ratio,
-        address _oracleID_Principle,
-        uint _startedLendingAmount
-    ) external;
-}
```

Importing the implementation from the main file will ensure that code is not unnecessarily duplicated in different files causing unnecessary reverts, and errors.
