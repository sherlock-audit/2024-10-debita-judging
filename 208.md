# The precision loss in the fee percentage for connecting offers results in the borrower paying less than the expected fee.

### Summary

Some of the borrowed principal tokens is charged as a fee for connecting transactions. The percentage of the fee is calculated according to `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:391`. There is a non-negligible precision loss in the calculation process. Since the default `feePerDay` is `4`, the maximum loss could reach up to `1/4` of the daily fee, which is significant, especially when the amount borrowed is substantial.
```solidity
391:    uint percentage = ((borrowInfo.duration * feePerDay) / 86400);  // @audit-issue 最多损失1/4天的费用
```

There are another 2 instances of the issue in `DebitaV3Load.sol:extendLoan`.
```solidity
571:    uint PorcentageOfFeePaid = ((m_loan.initialDuration * feePerDay) /
572:        86400);
```

```solidity
602:                uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /
603:                    86400);

### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:391`, rounding down the fee percentage can lead to a non-trivial precision loss.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

By setting the borrowing duration to `N days + 86400/4 - 1`, users can save the maximum fee.

### Impact

The precision loss in the fee percentage results in the borrower paying less than the expected fee, with the maximum loss potentially reaching up to `1/4` of the daily fee.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When calculating the fee percentage, rounding up; or multiplying by a multiple to increase precision.
