# `DebitaV3Loan::claimCollateralAsLender` calls `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` but does not check the returned bool, which could lead to the lender's nft being burned without claiming his collateral part if the borrower has been defaulted

### Summary

In the `DebitaV3Loan` contract the `claimCollateralAsLender` function call the internal function `claimCollateralAsNFTLender`, which returns a bool, but this result is not check, whether is was successful or not. This unchecked return value can be fasle, meaning that the lender did not get any portion of the collateral and his NFT is still burned and `collateralClaimed` is set to true.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability lays in this function call:

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Deadline should have passed, resulting in a default: `_nextDeadline < block.timestamp && _nextDeadline != 0`
2. The lender should have not claimed his collateral: `offer.collateralClaimed == false`
3. The collateral of the borrow offer should be an NFT - `m_loan.isCollateralNFT == true`
4. An auction should not be initialized - `m_loan.auctionInitialized == fasle`
5. There should be more than one lender in the lend offer; `m_loan._acceptedOffers.length != 1`

There are a lot of pre-conditions, but they are likely to happen

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A loan is created with more than one lenders and the borrower's collateral is a veNFT
2. The loan passes the deadline and is defaulted
3. One of the lenders decides to claim his collateral, but an auction has not been created yet
4. The lender calls `claimCollateralAsLender`, which burns his NFT that represent ownership then the internal `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` function is called and sets `collateralClaimed = true`. The result from `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` is not checked and the whole `claimCollateralAsLender` function passes. The lender does not get any amount of tokens. This also prevents further calls to actually claim his collateral, when the veNFT is sold, because of this check: `require(offer.collateralClaimed == false, "Already executed");`
5. Now the lender has no way of claiming his colleral

### Impact

1. No way for the lender to claim his collateral after calling `claimCollateralAsLender` with the mentioned pre-conditions, effectively locking his collateral forever.

### PoC

No PoC

### Mitigation

Make sure to check the returned bool of the `claimCollateralAsNFTLender` funciton call:

```diff
+    bool success = claimCollateralAsNFTLender(index);
+    require(success, "Not Successful");
```
