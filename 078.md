# `DebitaIncentives::incentivizePair` Unsafe Use of `ERC20.transferFrom` Could Artificially Inflate Balance

### Summary

The `incentivizePair` function in the `DebitaIncentives` contract allows users to bribe a principal-collateral pair in order to incentivize liquidity. However, a vulnerability exists in the current implementation. Specifically, when tokens are transferred to the `DebitaIncentives` contract, the contract does not enforce a whitelist on the tokens, meaning any ERC20 token could be used. Additionally, the contract calls `transferFrom` without checking the return value. This creates a potential attack vector, as a malicious user could use a token that returns `false` on failed transfers to incentivize a pair, causing the contract state to be incorrectly updated, even though the tokens were never actually transferred. Importantly, the only token checked against the whitelist is the principal token, leaving the incentive token unchecked. This issue could lead to the loss of funds.

```solidity
   function incentivizePair(
        address[] memory principles,
        address[] memory incentiveToken,
        bool[] memory lendIncentivize,
        uint[] memory amounts,
        uint[] memory epochs
    ) public {
        require(
            principles.length == incentiveToken.length &&
                incentiveToken.length == lendIncentivize.length &&
                lendIncentivize.length == amounts.length &&
                amounts.length == epochs.length,
            "Invalid input"
        );

        for (uint i; i < principles.length; i++) {
            uint epoch = epochs[i];
            address principle = principles[i];
            address incentivizeToken = incentiveToken[i];
            uint amount = amounts[i];

            require(epoch > currentEpoch(), "Epoch already started");
@>          require(isPrincipleWhitelisted[principle], "Not whitelisted");
// @> Only the principle is validated against the whitelist.

            ...

            // transfer the tokens
@>          IERC20(incentivizeToken).transferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                amount
            );
// @> In case the transferFrom returns false, the tx should revert

            // add the amount to the total amount of incentives
            if (lendIncentivize[i]) {
@>            lentIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch[principle][
                    hashVariables(incentivizeToken, epoch)
                ] += amount;
            } else {
@>            borrowedIncentivesPerTokenPerEpoch[principle][
                    hashVariables(incentivizeToken, epoch)
                ] += amount;
            }

            ...
        }
    }
```

### Root Cause

In [DebitaIncentives::incentivizePair](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L269), the return value of `ERC20.transferFrom` is not checked. Additionally, the bribe token is not validated against the whitelist, allowing an attacker to use a token that does not revert on a failed transfer, but instead returns `false`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls the `incentivizePair` function, passing an `incentiveToken` parameter (an array with a single element) that points to a token which does not revert on failed transfers. 
2. The attacker deliberately fails to provide the necessary token allowance to the `DebitaIncentives` contract, causing the `transferFrom` function to fail and return `false` instead of reverting. 
3. As a result, the contract incorrectly updates its state, despite no actual transfer of tokens taking place.


### Impact

- The contract's balance may be artificially inflated, as no tokens are actually transferred to the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Implement a whitelist for bribe tokens and use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom` to ensure proper token transfer handling and security.
