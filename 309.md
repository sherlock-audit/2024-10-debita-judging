# Multiple Cancellations of the Same Lend Offer, Triggering Repeated LendOrderDeleted and LendOrderUpdated Events

### Summary

A vulnerability exists in the `DebitaLendOffer-Implementation::cancelOffer` function, which allows an attacker to **cancel the same lend offer multiple times**. This occurs when the attacker first calls `addFunds` on a canceled order, and then calls `cancelOffer` again. The repeated cancellations lead to the `DebitaLendOfferFactory::emitDelete` and `DebitaLendOfferFactory::emitUpdate` functions being invoked multiple times, triggering the `LendOrderDeleted` and `LendOrderUpdated` events multiple times for the same order. This results in incorrect contract behavior and misleading event logs.

### Vulnerability Details

1. **Attack Flow: Repeated Cancellations via `addFunds`**:
   - The attacker creates a lend offer via `DebitaLendOfferFactory::createLendOrder`.
   - The attacker then calls `DebitaLendOffer-Implementation::cancelOffer` to cancel the offer.
   - After the offer is canceled, the attacker **calls `addFunds`** on the same canceled order. The `addFunds` function does not validate whether the order is still active, so it allows the attacker to add additional funds to the canceled order.
   - Once funds are added, the attacker can **call `cancelOffer` again** on the same order. Since the `cancelOffer` function does not check the `isActive` status, it allows the canceled order to be canceled again.
   - This leads to the repeated triggering of the `DebitaLendOfferFactory::emitDelete` function, which causes the `LendOrderDeleted` event to be emitted multiple times for the same order, even though the order has already been canceled.

2. **Incorrect Event Emissions**:
   - The `LendOrderDeleted` event is intended to be triggered once when a lend order is deleted. However, due to the repeated cancellations, the event is incorrectly triggered multiple times for the same order.
   - This results in **misleading event logs**, where the same order is marked as "deleted" multiple times, which could confuse external systems and users that rely on this event to track canceled orders.

3. **Impact on External Systems and Protocol Integrity**:
   - External systems that rely on the `LendOrderDeleted` event to track the status of orders may be misled into thinking that an order has been deleted multiple times. This could cause synchronization issues with external applications or state inconsistencies in those systems.
   - Additionally, repeated emissions of the `LendOrderDeleted` event may cause **incorrect state updates** and undermine the protocol’s ability to accurately manage and track active lend offers.

    function cancelOffer() public onlyOwner nonReentrant {
 @> Missing isActive check
        uint availableAmount = lendInformation.availableAmount;
        lendInformation.perpetual = false;
        lendInformation.availableAmount = 0;

        require(availableAmount > 0, "No funds to cancel");

        isActive = false;

        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            availableAmount
        );
     
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitDelete(address(this));
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).deleteOrder(address(this));
        // emit canceled event on factory
    }
```

```solidity
    function addFunds(uint amount) public nonReentrant {
 @> Missing isActive check
        require(
            msg.sender == lendInformation.owner ||
                IAggregator(aggregatorContract).isSenderALoan(msg.sender),
            "Only owner or loan"
        );
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        lendInformation.availableAmount += amount;
        IDLOFactory(factoryContract).emitUpdate(address(this));
    }
```

### Root Cause

In [DebitaLendOffer-Implementation::cancelOffer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L144) and [DebitaLendOffer-Implementation::addFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162) lack of `isActive` validation.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates an order via `DebitaLendOfferFactory::createLendOrder`.
2. The attacker repeatedly calls `cancelOffer`, `addFunds`, `cancelOffer`, ...


### Impact

- **Incorrect Event Emissions**: The `LendOrderDeleted` event is emitted multiple times for the same order, leading to misleading logs and inaccurate tracking of canceled orders.
- **Protocol Integrity**: The vulnerability affects the protocol’s ability to accurately track and manage lend offers, potentially causing issues with order deletion, event emissions, and user fund management.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Prevent Multiple Cancellations**: Add a check in the `cancelOffer` function to verify if the order has already been canceled (by checking the `isActive` flag). If the order is already canceled, the function should revert and prevent any further cancellations.

2. **Prevent Fund Addition to Canceled Orders**: Modify the `addFunds` function to check whether the lend offer is active before allowing additional funds to be added. This ensures that no funds can be added to a canceled order, preventing the attacker from manipulating the offer's state.

3. **Correct Event Emissions**: Ensure that the `LendOrderDeleted` event is emitted only once per order. The contract should check the order’s status before emitting the event to ensure it is not triggered multiple times for the same order. The `emitDelete` function should be called only if the order is truly being deleted for the first time.
