# changeOwner function dosen't work properly

### Summary

changeOwner function dosen't work properly

### Root Cause

1- The condition require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner"); is incorrect because msg.sender is being checked against the parameter owner, which could be a different address. This does not verify the caller is the current contract owner.
2-In the line `owner = owner;`, the local parameter owner shadows the state variable owner. This means you're assigning the parameter owner to itself instead of modifying the state variable

### PoC

### Mitigation

```diff
     // change owner of the contract only between 0 and 6 hours after deployment
-    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
+    function changeOwner(address _owner) public {//@audit changeOwner doesn't work properly
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
         require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
-        owner = owner;
+        owner = _owner;
     }
```
