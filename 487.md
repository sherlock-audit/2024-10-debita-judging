# Insufficient oracle validation

## Summary
``DebitaChainlink::getThePrice``  is used to get the price of tokens, the problem is that [the function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L42C8-L42C59) does not check for freshness on price.
## Vulnerability Details
There is no freshness check on the timestamp of the prices, so old prices may be used if [[OCR](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting)](https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) was unable to push an update in time.
## Impact
Old prices mean users will get wrong values for their assets, and since the token prices are used in many contracts, stale data could be catastrophic for the project.
## Code Snippet
The timestamp field is ignored, which means there's no way to check whether the price is recent enough:
```javascript
 (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
```

## Tool Used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Add a staleness threshold number of seconds configuration parameter, and ensure that the price fetched is within that time range.
Also consider to add checks on the return data with proper revert messages if the price is stale or the round is incomplete.
