# Users can end up consuming stale Chainlink oracle price.

### Summary

The missing price staleness check in `getThePrice` function in `DebitaChainlink.sol` can cause the oracle price to end up using stale prices. This can lead to undesirable conditions e.g. bad debt.

### Root Cause

Missing price staleness check in `getThePrice` function in `DebitaChainlink.sol` (it only checks for Chainlink uptime feed, but not the oracle price itself). The code only uses `price` output from the `priceFeed.latestRoundData()`.

See [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L42-L46)

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- Oracle prices move very volatile
- Chainlink price feed stops feeding (or get stuck) e.g. due to gas spikes or network congestion.

### Attack Path

1. Token price changes very volatile
2. Attacker sees that the actual token price should already change, but the Chainlink oracle price has not updated yet for some reason.
3. Attacker sees that attacker can collateralize token A and borrow out token B with value B > value A (possibly due to oracle prices being volatile and don't get updated).

### Impact

If Chainlink oracle is used in conjunction with other sources, then it may lead to price discrepancy (and may make tx revert if discrepancy is checked). If there's no check, then it's possible that the protocol ends up using the stale oracle price, which can lead to potential attack vectors e.g. attacker can lend and borrow using old oracle pries, which can actually create a bad debt in the system.

### Mitigation

Check price staleness to a certain time interval e.g. 10 min.
