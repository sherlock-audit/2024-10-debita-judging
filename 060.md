# Inability to edit floor price of liquidation auction

### Summary

We know that a Dutch auction for a defaulted loan has a floor price ranging [between 5% and 30%](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L192)

In situations where the Dutch liquidation floor price remains unattractive to buyers, such as in the case of a long-duration loan where the collateral value has significantly decreased, it is essential to have a mechanism to maximize the value recovered from the collateral. We want to avoid scenarios where buyers are unwilling to pay 30% of the collateral value, but would be interested at 29%. Utilizing the existing editFloorPrice() function would be beneficial in this context. Lenders would prefer to receive 29% of the collateral's value rather than nothing at all.

### Root Cause

[editFloorPrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L192) is not used in `DebitaV3Loan`
