# Lenders blacklisted from USDT can prevent borrowers from paying their debt

### Summary

When a user creates a lend offer, they can opt for a perpetual offer. This means that when a borrower repays their debt, the funds are automatically reinvested into the lending offer, ready to be lent again.

```solidity
    function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
      ...
      if (lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer) {
          loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
          IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);
    ðŸ“Œ    lendOffer.addFunds(total);
      } else {
```

If the principal token is USDT and the lender is blacklisted (USDT on Arbitrum supports blacklist functionality), the borrower **cannot repay their debt**.

This issue is exacerbated when loans are extended. Borrowers must repay by `nextDeadline()`, and failure to repay one offer could lead to defaults across all offers, causing additional damage.

### Root Cause

When a borrower calls `payDebt()`, the function attempts to call `lendOffer.addFunds()`, which internally calls `safeTransferFrom` to transfer the funds back to the lending offer.

```solidity
    function addFunds(uint amount) public nonReentrant {
        ...
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(lendInformation.principle),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
    }
```

If the lending is blacklisted, the `safeTransferFrom` call will revert, making it impossible for the borrrower to repay the debt.

### Internal pre-conditions

The lending offer must have the **perpetual** option **enabled**.


### External pre-conditions

The lender must be blacklisted from USDT between the time of matching the offers and the repayment.


### Attack Path

1. A lender creates a perpetual lending offer.
2. The lender is blacklisted from USDT after the offer is matched with a borrower.
3. The borrower attempts to repay the debt but is unable to because the `lendOffer.addFunds()` call reverts.
4. If the borrower cannot repay before the deadline, they default on all active offers, causing cascading damage.

### Impact

Lenders getting blacklisted will harm other users of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If the `safeTransferFrom` call fails, catch the error and fall back to the non-perpetual repayment logic from the `else` case. This ensures that borrowers can repay their debt without being affected by the lender's blacklist status.
