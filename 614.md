# the owner can't upgrade the contract because of Immutable Proxy Implementation

### Summary

The immutable implementation design in the proxy contract will cause potential security risks for all users as malicious actors will be able to exploit any discovered vulnerabilities that cannot be patched due to the inability to upgrade the contract logic

### Root Cause

In `DebitaProxyContract.sol:6-13` the implementation address is set only in the constructor with no upgrade mechanism:

```solidity
constructor(address _logic) {
    bytes32 implementationPosition = bytes32(
        uint256(keccak256("eip1967.implementationSlot")) - 1
    );
    assembly {
        sstore(implementationPosition, _logic)
    }
}
```

This design choice to make the implementation immutable is a mistake as it prevents any future updates, including critical security patches.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to be deployed with initial implementation address
2. Any user needs to interact with proxy contract functionality
3. A vulnerability needs to be discovered in the implementation logic

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker discovers a vulnerability in the implementation contract
2. Due to immutable implementation, the protocol cannot deploy a fix
3. Attacker exploits the vulnerability affecting all users of the proxy
4. Protocol is forced to deploy entirely new contracts
5. Users must manually migrate to new contracts, risking funds during migration


### Impact

The protocol and its users suffer from:
- Inability to patch security vulnerabilities
- Forced contract redeployments
- Expensive and risky migration processes
- Potential complete loss of funds if critical vulnerabilities are discovered
- Limited protocol evolution and feature updates

### Mitigation

Implement UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)
