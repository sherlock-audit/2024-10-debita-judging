# Cross contract read-only reentrancy in the Auction contract

### Summary

The buyNFT and of the Auction contract don't respect the Check effect interaction pattern this lead to a cross contract read-only reentrancy.

### Root Cause

At the end of the buyNFT function the function use transfer the NFT with safeTransferFrom that will perform a call back to the msg.sender if the msg.sender is a smart contract but delete the order in the AuctionFactory after the call
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L148-L155

The function that is called is this one in the AuctionFactory : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L145-L160

This function modify three state variable : 
 AuctionOrderIndex 
allActiveAuctionOrders 
activeOrdersCount

If another protocol is integrating with debita and use one of this variable it could lead to a vulnerability.

It's the same in the cancelAuction function : 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L172-L178

### Internal pre-conditions

none.

### External pre-conditions

1. A protocole must integrating with debita and read the state of the AuctionFactory

### Attack Path

1. A user create a smart contract that implement a mallicious callback
2. The mallicious user exploit the protocol that integrate with Debita

### Impact

A protocol that integrate with debita can be exploited if it use the state of the AuctionFactory.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

   Change the order of the two last call in the cancelAuction and buyNFT functions like that :
   ```solidity
   
        auctionFactory(factory)._deleteAuctionOrder(address(this));
 Token.safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            msg.sender,
            s_CurrentAuction.nftCollateralID
        );


```
