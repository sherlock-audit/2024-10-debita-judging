# DoS Due To USDT Approval

 ### Summary

As we can clearly see the protocol is meant to support USDT. However, the `payDebt` and `extendLoan` functions of the `DebitaV3Loan` contract does not seem to do so.

### Root Cause

The USDT contract doesn't implement the IERC20 interface correctly. Namely, functions that are supposed to return a bool (like `approve` used in the beforementioned functions) don't. The functions `payDebt` and `extendLoan` will always revert when using USDT for that reason.
