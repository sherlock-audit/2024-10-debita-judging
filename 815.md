# Division before multiplication in `DebitaIncentives::claimIncentives` can cause some users to receive zero rewards

### Summary

In the `claimIncentives()` function, calculating the percentage of lent and borrowed amounts using division before multiplication leads to integer truncation. As a result, users who have lent or borrowed relatively smaller amounts than the total receive zero rewards from the incentive pool, despite being eligible. 

### Root Cause

This occurs because the calculated percentage becomes zero when the user's amount is small compared to the total, causing their reward calculation to yield zero.
In [`DebitaIncentives:161`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L161) and [`DebitaIncentives:175`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L175), the percentage calculations for lent and borrowed amounts are performed using division before multiplication :
```js
porcentageLent = (lentAmount * 10000) / totalLentAmount;
porcentageBorrow = (borrowAmount * 10000) / totalBorrowAmount;
```
When `lentAmount` or `borrowAmount` is small relative to `totalLentAmount` or `totalBorrowAmount`, the resulting `porcentageLent` or `porcentageBorrow` becomes zero. Consequently, when calculating `amountToClaim`, the user ends up receiving zero incentives. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There are incentives (`lentIncentive` or `borrowIncentive`) available for distribution.
2. The user's `lentAmount` or `borrowAmount` is 10000 smaller than the `totalLentAmount` or `totalBorrowAmount`
3. User calls `claimIncentives()`

### External pre-conditions

The total lent or borrowed amounts are large, making individual small amounts negligible when calculating percentages.

### Impact

Many users will receive no rewards from the incentive pool, leading to unfair distribution and dissatisfaction. This undermines the incentive mechanism intended to encourage participation from users of all sizes.

### PoC

A very simplified example demonstrating the issue:

- `totalLentAmount` = 1,000,000 units
- `lentAmount` = 99 units (user's lent amount)
- `lentIncentive` = 2,000,000 units (total incentives for lending)

```js
porcentageLent = (99 * 10000) / 1,000,000 = 0 (due to integer division)

amountToClaim = (2,000,000 * 0) / 10000 = 0
```
The user receives zero incentives.

However, using the correct calculation (Multiplication Before Division):
```js
amountToClaim = (2,000,000 * 99) / 1,000,000 = 198 units
```
The user correctly receives 198 units as their share of the incentives.

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, perform multiplication before division to maintain precision:

```js
amountToClaimLender = lentIncentive * lentAmount;
amountToClaimBorrower = borrowIncentive * borrowAmount;

amountToClaim = (amountToClaimLender + amountToClaimBorrower ) / (totalLentAmount + totalBorrowAmount);

```
Dividing at the very end will allow for the least pricision loss.
