# [M-3] Using `_mint` instead of `_safeMint` in `TaxTokensReceipt.sol` risks potentially locking user assets.

### Summary

The `deposit` function in `TaxTokensReceipt.sol` mints ERC-721 tokens using the `_mint` function instead of `_safeMint`. This approach bypasses an important safety mechanism that ensures recipient contracts (smart wallets) can properly receive and manage ERC-721 tokens. If the recipient is an incompatible contract (smart wallet), such as one that does not implement the `IERC721Receiver::onERC721Received`, the minted tokens may become irretrievable, leading to a potential loss of user funds.

### Root Cause

The `TaxTokensReceipt::deposit` uses the [`_mint`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/TaxTokensReceipts/TaxTokensReceipt.sol#L72) function to mint ERC-721 tokens:

```js
function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
@>        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
        return tokenID;
    }
```

Unlike `_safeMint`, the `_mint` function does not verify the recipient's ability to handle ERC-721 tokens. This lack of verification can lead to scenarios where tokens are sent to contracts (smart wallets) that do not implement the required `IERC721Receiver` interface, rendering those tokens irretrievable. The `_safeMint` function allows re-entrancy by calling `checkOnERC721Received` on the token's receiver. However, the `TaxTokensReceipt::deposit` function uses the `nonReentrant` modifier as a security measure against reentrancy attacks.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

The protocol user deposits tokens using the `TaxTokensReceipt::deposit` function, which internally uses the `_mint` function to create ERC-721 tokens without performing compatibility checks. The recipient address is a smart wallet that does not implement the ERC721Receiver interface or is unable to handle ERC-721 tokens correctly.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Using the `TaxTokensReceipt::deposit` function, protocol users can deposit their ERC-20 tokens into the contract and receive an ERC-721 token in return. However, if the recipient of the ERC-721 token is an incompatible smart wallet, the NFT will be stuck in the smart wallet contract due to the lack of a mechanism to handle ERC-721 tokens and will become irretrievable.

### Mitigation

Consider using `_safeMint` in the `TaxTokensReceipt::deposit` function:

```diff
function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
-        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
+       _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenID);
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
        return tokenID;
    }
```
