# `updateFunds()` function in `DebitaIncentives` contract skips potentially valid token pairs

### Summary

When `updateFunds()` is called at the end of the `matchOffersV3()` function execution it should update the funds of the user and the amount of the principle for any `principle/collateral` token pair that is whitelisted. However, as seen below when the loop finds a pair that is not whitelisted it returns instead of continuing to iterate through `informationOffers` array, ignoring potentially valid pairs.

### Root Cause

`DebitaIncentives:updateFunds()` function returns instead of continuing to iterate through subsequent token pairs.

### Internal pre-conditions

- more than one principle token is borrowed
- that principle token and borrower's collateral token are not a whitelisted pair in `DebitaIncentives`
- this pair is not the last one in `informationOffers` array

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Incorrect implementation of the function causes unfair loss of incentives. 

The more principle tokens are *after* the unwhitelisted pair in `informationOffers` array the more incentives are lost.

### Mitigation

Consider the following change :
```diff
  if (!validPair) {
-               return;
+               continue;
            }
```
