# Adversary lender can delete other existing lend offer count could affect the matching process

### Summary

The vulnerability lies in the lending offer implementation contract cancel function(`DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol:cancelOffer`) which transfers back the principal amount and calls the delete order function(`DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol:deleteOrder`) on the factory contract from where the matching order/offer bot could collect for the matching process. Calling the cancel function also decreases the active order count(`activeOrdersCount`) which is a global variable and essential while fetching the active orders(`DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol:getActiveOrders`). The adversary lender creates a lending order from the factory and cancels it claiming the principal amount it transferred while making the offer. Again it transfers the smallest unit of the principal amount via `DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol:addFunds`  and calls the cancel(`DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol:cancelOffer`) making the active order count decrease and getting that smallest unit back. The attacker can loop the process till the active orders are reduced to zero. This affects the matching of a valid order or other service queries the `getActiveOrders` lacks the active, valid order 

### Root Cause

The function [`addFunds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L162) and [`cancelOffer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol#L144) in the contract `DebitaLendOffer-Implementation.sol` are the function that makes the attack possible. Where the root cause lies in both `addFunds` and `cancelOffer` to allow adding the fund to an already canceled offer makes the condition of `availableAmount>0` possible in `cancelOffer` function to call and successfully decrease the [`activeOrderCount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L219) global variable 

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

1. Lend offer creator creates the lending offer
2. Cancel it and get the principal amount transferred
3. Transfers the smallest unit just `>0`  from the `addFunds` 
4. Cancels it again
5. Loops till the `activeOrderCount` gets to zero

### Impact

Since the matching bot can be deployed or the matching function can be called by anyone these kinds of services could rely upon the [`getActiveOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L222) then the impact is high as it loops through and till the `activeOrdersCount`  

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Don't allow to cancel the already canceled order. If the valid lend offer creator cancels it, the perpetual status gets set to `false` and the funds would never come back to the `LendOfferImplementaion` contract again adding funds to an already canceled offer could also be prohibited as perpetual funds would never be deposited here if canceled already
