# Direct Implementation Deployment Instead of Proxy in Borrow Offer Creation

### Summary

In [DBOImplementation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L10) [(borrow offer)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L106) is deployed directly instead of using a proxy. This approach bypasses the intended proxy architecture and results in the creation of an independent instance of DBOImplementation even though the DebitaProxyContract is imported.


### Root Cause

While creating a new borrow offer, the code instantiates DBOImplementation directly:
```solidity
DBOImplementation borrowOffer = new DBOImplementation();
```
This direct instantiation ignores the proxy pattern, which would have allowed for upgradeability by pointing to a logic contract through a proxy. The correct deployment approach, as shown in other sections of the contract (e.g., [the lending offer creation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L151-L157)), should involve wrapping the implementation in a proxy.
