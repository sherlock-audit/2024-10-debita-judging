# Incorrectly implemented `changeOwner` function across `buyOrderFactory`, `AuctionFactory` and `DebitaV3Aggregator` contracts does not allow changing the owner.

### Summary

The `changeOwner` function is used for changing the owner across `buyOrderFactory`, `AuctionFactory` and `DebitaV3Aggregator` contracts respectively.
```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```
There are two issues here:-
 1.  The require check `require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");` which takes the local `owner`, i.e `owner` from parameter and checks against the `msg.sender` instead of taking the contract's `owner`
 2. The way owner is being assigned ->  `owner = owner`, this will shadow the actual `owner` of the contract and assign it to the parameter passed, disallowing the admin to change owner.

### Root Cause

In [`buyOrderFactory.sol:189`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L189), [`AuctionFactory.sol:221`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L221) and [`DebitaV3Aggregator.sol:685`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L685), there is an issue with the way `owner` is getting assigned, as well as the require block taking the shadowing owner, i.e owner from parameter instead of actual contract's `owner`
```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");   <@ - Shadowing occurs here
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;       <@ - Shadowing occurs here
    }
```
This will not allow the admin to change owner as intended.

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin needs to be owner

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls any of the change owner functions in the `buyOrderFactory`, `AuctionFactory` and `DebitaV3Aggregator` contracts.

### Impact

The admin cannot change the owner of the mentioned contracts, this can be crucial in a case where admin keys get compromised or there's a need to change owner as per business requirements.

### PoC

The below test case was added in `BuyOrder.t.sol`
```solidity
    function testChangeOwner() public {
        // Get current owner
        address currentOwner = factory.owner();
        
        // We need to prank as the owner to change the owner
        vm.startPrank(currentOwner);
        vm.expectRevert("Only owner");
        factory.changeOwner(address(0x01)); // <@ - Change owner will always fail unless the param is the actual owner, which is not useful
        
    }
 ```

### Mitigation

It is recommended to change the parameter of `changeOwner` functions from `owner` to `_owner`.
```diff
-   function changeOwner(address owner) public {
+   function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
-       owner = owner;
+       owner = _owner; 
    }
```
