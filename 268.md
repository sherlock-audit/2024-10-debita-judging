# malicious user can steal collateral nft

### Summary

When the lender or borrower calls createAuctionForCollateral, the createAuction function of the auctionFactoryDebita contract is triggered.
This function creates a new auction contract (DutchAuction_veNFT), where msg.sender (the caller) is passed as the creator of the auction

The creator of the auction is the caller of the createAuctionForCollateral function (either the lender or borrower).
Inside the auctionFactoryDebita contract, msg.sender is passed to the DutchAuction_veNFT contract as the auction creator

A new auction contract is deployed, the NFT (collateral) is transferred to it, and the auction is set up with the specified parameters (e.g., initial amount, floor price, duration).

        // create auction and save the information
        IERC721(m_loan.collateral).approve(
            address(auctionFactory),
            m_loan.NftID
        );
        address liveAuction = auctionFactory.createAuction(
            m_loan.NftID,
            m_loan.collateral,
            receiptInfo.underlying,
            receiptInfo.lockedAmount,
            floorAmount,
            864000
        );


        auctionData = AuctionData({
            auctionAddress: liveAuction,
            liquidationAddress: receiptInfo.underlying,
            soldAmount: 0,
            tokenPerCollateralUsed: 0,
            alreadySold: false
        });
        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));


in the createauction function in auctionfactory.sol

    function createAuction(
        uint _veNFTID,
        address _veNFTAddress,
        address liquidationToken,
        uint _initAmount,
        uint _floorAmount,
        uint _duration
    ) public returns (address) {
        // check if aggregator is set
        require(aggregator != address(0), "Aggregator not set");


        // initAmount should be more than floorAmount
        require(_initAmount >= _floorAmount, "Invalid amount");
        DutchAuction_veNFT _createdAuction = new DutchAuction_veNFT(
            _veNFTID,
            _veNFTAddress,
            liquidationToken,
            msg.sender, ///  @audit  <-- Here, msg.sender is passed as the auction creator

            _initAmount,
            _floorAmount,
            _duration,
            IAggregator(aggregator).isSenderALoan(msg.sender) // if the sender is a loan --> isLiquidation = true
        );


        // Transfer veNFT
        IERC721(_veNFTAddress).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(_createdAuction),
            _veNFTID,
            ""
        );


now the problem is when a user calls buynft in auction.sol

    function buyNFT() public onlyActiveAuction {
        // get memory data
        dutchAuction_INFO memory m_currentAuction = s_CurrentAuction;
        // get current price of the auction
        uint currentPrice = getCurrentPrice();
        // desactivate auction from storage
        s_CurrentAuction.isActive = false;
        uint fee;
        if (m_currentAuction.isLiquidation) {
            fee = auctionFactory(factory).auctionFee();
        } else {
            fee = auctionFactory(factory).publicAuctionFee();
        }


        // calculate fee
        uint feeAmount = (currentPrice * fee) / 10000;
        // get fee address
        address feeAddress = auctionFactory(factory).feeAddress();
        // Transfer liquidation token from the buyer to the owner of the auction
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
            msg.sender, 
            s_ownerOfAuction, //@audit <-- here the full amount is transferred to the creator of the auction which is the msg.sender
            currentPrice - feeAmount
        );


        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20(m_currentAuction.sellingToken),
            msg.sender,
            feeAddress,
            feeAmount
        );


        // If it's a liquidation, handle it properly
        if (m_currentAuction.isLiquidation) {
            debitaLoan(s_ownerOfAuction).handleAuctionSell(
                currentPrice - feeAmount
            );
        }
        IERC721 Token = IERC721(s_CurrentAuction.nftAddress);
        Token.safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            msg.sender,
            s_CurrentAuction.nftCollateralID
        );


        auctionFactory(factory)._deleteAuctionOrder(address(this));
        auctionFactory(factory).emitAuctionDeleted(
            address(this),
            s_ownerOfAuction
        );
ownerofauction is defined here

this is problematic because if a borrower who didnt repay his loan amount calls this createauction he will be the auction creator and the borrower can walk away taking his collateral without repaying anything and if a lender calls this he can also take the full amount received from selling the nft

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. attacker calls createauctionforcollateral
2. a new auction is created and the msg.sender is passed as the creator of auction
3. a user buysnft and the liquidation token is transferred to the creator pf auction
4. borrower/lender will lose funds based on who called the creatauctionforcollateral

### Impact

loss of funds for for the innocent party

### PoC

1. Auction Creator: The caller of createAuctionForCollateral (either lender or borrower) is passed as msg.sender.

2. Passing msg.sender: In the createAuction function, msg.sender is passed to the constructor as the creator of the auction

3. Auction Deployment: The DutchAuction_veNFT contract is deployed, and the caller (lender or borrower) is treated as the creator of the auction
4.  the liquidation token is transferred to the auction creator  (msg.sender)

### Mitigation

dont transfer the liquidation token to the auction creator or distribute it according to the amount the user is entitled to
