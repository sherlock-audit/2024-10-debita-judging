# Owner Update Fails Due to Variable Shadowing in changeOwner

### Summary

The changeOwner function in the DebitaV3Aggregator, auctionFactoryDebita, and buyOrderFactory contracts fails to update the owner storage variable correctly. This issue arises because the function parameter owner shadows the owner storage variable, causing the assignment within the function to modify the local parameter instead of updating the contract's state.



### Root Cause

In the changeOwner function, the input parameter owner has the same name as the contract's storage variable owner. This causes the local variable to take precedence over the storage variable within the function's scope. As a result, the assignment owner = owner updates the local variable, leaving the storage variable unchanged.

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```

### Impact

 The owner storage variable remains unchanged, preventing ownership transfer.

### Mitigation

Rename the function parameter to avoid shadowing the owner storage variable. Alternatively, explicitly reference the storage variable using the this keyword or directly qualify it.

```solidity
function changeOwner(address newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = newOwner; // Explicitly updates the storage variable
}
```
