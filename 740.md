# Debt can be forced liquidated if lender is blacklisted

### Summary

In Debita V3, loans operate on a time-based liquidation system rather than a price-based model, ensuring the loan concludes either when the borrower fully repays their debt or fails to meet a payment deadline. Loan contracts are formed by matching multiple lenders' orders with a borrower's order. However, if a lender's contract is associated with money laundering for example and becomes blacklisted, it prevents debt repayment, ultimately leading to the liquidation of the collateral.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaV3Loan::payDebt()`, the function determines whether the lending order is perpetual, in which case repayments are directed to the contract instead of the lender. This creates an edge case where the lending order may be associated with money laundering and becomes blacklisted for tokens like USDC. As a result, the borrowerâ€™s repayment attempts will fail because `approve` cannot be executed. This failure prevents full debt repayment, ultimately leading to loan liquidation.

```solidity
            // if the lender is the owner of the offer and the offer is perpetual, then add the funds to the offer
            if (lendInfo.perpetual && lendInfo.owner == currentOwnerOfOffer) {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].debtClaimed = true;
                IERC20(offer.principle).approve(address(lendOffer), total);
                lendOffer.addFunds(total);
            } else {
                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim =
                    interest -
                    feeOnInterest;
            }
```

We can see that USDC contract checks if spender which is the lender contract is blacklisted using `notBlacklisted` modifier.  Key issue here is that tokens can enforce blacklisting independently, not by the protocol, but due to malicious activities associated with the contract, this can cause the loan to be defaulted and then liquidated.
```solidity
   /**
     * @notice Sets a fiat token allowance for a spender to spend on behalf of the caller.
     * @param spender The spender's address.
     * @param value   The allowance amount.
     * @return True if the operation was successful.
     */
    function approve(address spender, uint256 value)
        external
        virtual
        override
        whenNotPaused
        notBlacklisted(msg.sender)
        notBlacklisted(spender)
        returns (bool)
    {
        _approve(msg.sender, spender, value);
        return true;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1) Lender's contract is set to perpetual and has more than 1 underlying token in contract.

### External pre-conditions

1) The lender's contract is blacklisted by commonly used tokens like USDC or USDT.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The loan is liquidated because the debt cannot be repaid causing borrower to lose their collateral.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address the issue of blacklisted tokens within lending orders, you can add a try/catch block and additional checks to handle such cases gracefully. If the lending order is blacklisted, you could assume the debt to that lender does not need to be repaid, allowing the borrower to absorb the borrowed principal.
