# DBOImplementation is always deployed without a proxy and won't be upgradable as expected

### Summary

The `DBOImplementation` contract is directly instantiated in the [`createBorrowOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L106) function of the `DBOFactory` contract without using a proxy. Based on conversations with the sponsor, this deviates from the protocol's design, which expects the implementation contracts to be deployed through proxies, making them upgradable. As a result, DBOImplementation is not upgradable, creating a significant risk for the protocolâ€™s maintainability and upgradability. 

### Root Cause

The `implementationContract` contract address is [initialized](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L53) in the constructor, on the deployment of the `DBOFactory` contract. 
The contract is supposed to instantiate a new `DebitaProxyContract` contract, passint the `implementationContract`as the constructor argument , then cast the proxy contract address `(borrowOfferProxy)` to the type DBOImplementation, for calls to be easily made to the implementation contract through the proxy.
This is the expected architectural design for the `DBOFactory` contract and the `DLOFactory` contract. Although, the `DLOFactory` contract correctly implemented it [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L151), but the `DBOFactory` did not.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

1. The `DBOImplementation` contract will not be upgraded as against the intended architecture
2. If a critical bug or vulnerability is discovered in DBOImplementation, it cannot be patched without redeploying the contract, resulting in possible loss of user data or funds.

            require(_collateralAmount == 1, "Started Borrow Amount must be 1");
        }

        require(_LTVs.length == _acceptedPrinciples.length, "Invalid LTVs");
        require(
            _oracleIDS_Principles.length == _acceptedPrinciples.length,
