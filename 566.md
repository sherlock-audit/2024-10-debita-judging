# `aggregatorContract` is not checked wheather it's been initilized or not in `DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory::createBorrowOrder()`

### Summary

In the code line -
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L108

```js
    borrowOffer.initialize(
        aggregatorContract,
        msg.sender,
        _acceptedPrinciples,
        _collateral,
        _oraclesActivated,
        _isNFT,
        _LTVs,
        _maxInterestRate,
        _duration,
        _receiptID,
        _oracleIDS_Principles,
        _ratio,
        _oracleID_Collateral,
        _collateralAmount
    );
```
An unitilized `aggregatorContract` will be zero address, which will lead to creation of an order whose aggregator is zero. If `aggregatorContract` is checked in other function for zero address, it will revert causing DOS for an created borrowOrder and if it's not checked thoughout any other function and that function deal with transfering token to `aggregatorContract`, then the funds will be lost.

### Root Cause

`aggregatorContract` isn't checked wheather it's zero address or not.

### Internal pre-conditions

`aggregatorContract` not being set before initilization of borrowOffer.

### External pre-conditions

1. Creation of an borrow order, whose `aggregatorContract` is 0 address.
2. Will lead to DOS if `aggregatorContract` value checked elsewhere in other function.
3. Funds can be lost if `aggregatorContract` value not checked in a function, as it is a 0 address. 

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. Creation of an borrow order, whose `aggregatorContract` is 0 address.
2. Will lead to DOS if `aggregatorContract` value checked elsewhere in other function.
3. Funds can be lost if `aggregatorContract` value not checked in a function, as it is a 0 address.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Setting the `aggregatorContract` address through `setAggregatorContract()` function, and make sure that it's been set via require statement before borrowOrder initilization.
