# Attacker can easly gain ownership over `AuctionFactory.sol` & `buyOrderFactory.sol`

## Summary

In `buyOrderFactory.sol` and  `AuctionFactory.sol`  there is a function called `changeOwner()` which should be callable only by the `owner address` of conract. It  checks if `msg.sender == owner` and if no more than `6 hours ` have passed after the deployment of the contract, only then the tx will go through. The function accepts address variable named `owner` which shadows the extisting `owner` address declaration of the contract which leads to critical vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Detail

Because of the `owner` param shadowing , an attacker can easly change the ownership of `buyOrderFactory.sol` and  `AuctionFactory.sol` . While the 6 hours after deployment didnt pass everyone can steal his ownership as well, so at the end he can use a MEV bot just before the `6 hours` to pass and gain ownership , after that no one will be able to rescue the factory contracts.

In the first case in `buyOrderFactory.sol` by becoming the owner of the contract the attacker can only call `changeFee()` and change `sellFee` making it cheap or expensive ( from 0.2% to 1% max ) . 

In the second case in `AuctionFactory.sol` he will be able to call `setFloorPriceForLiquidations()`, `changeAuctionFee()`, `changePublicAuctionFee`, `setAggregator()`, `setFeeAddress()`. By having access over all of these important functions , like setting low or high fees, stealing fees by setting his own address for `feeAddress` or setting his own `aggegator address` he can manipulate the auction functionalities and make no incentives for the users to participate in the protocol.

## Impact

Attacker can easly get ownership over two core contracts and gain access over core functionalities which can change important values which are usable by the users interacting with the protocol and steal funds by setting his own address as `feeAddress`

## Code Snippet

[`AuctionFactory::changeOwner()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/AuctionFactory.sol#L218-L222)

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```


[`buyOrderFactory::changeOwner()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L186-L190)

```solidity
    function changeOwner(address owner) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
        owner = owner;
    }
```

## PoC

In Remix if you try to deploy the contract with `address1` and then try to call `changeOwner()` with setting new owner address the tx reverts, but if you try to call the function from `address2` by setting his address as the new owner for example the tx passes.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Test {
address owner;
    constructor(){

        owner = msg.sender;
    }
       
    
    function getOwner() external view returns(address)
    {
        return owner;
    }

     function changeOwner(address owner) public { 
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
        owner = owner;
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Remix IDE

## Recommendation

Change function parameter of `changeOwner()` to `newOwner` and set `owner == newOwner`
