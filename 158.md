# In `acceptBorrowOffer`, the check for whether the borrowing order is completed is incorrect in some situations.

### Summary

In `DebitaBorrowOffer-Implementation.sol:163`, the `percentageOfAvailableCollateral` is rounded down, leading to an incorrect check for whether the borrowing order is completed. If `m_borrowInformation.startAmount * 10 < borrowInformation.availableAmount * 10000 <  m_borrowInformation.startAmount * 11`, where the actual available amount is greater than the start amount's 0.1%, the borrowing order should remain valid. However, it is incorrectly marked as completed because `percentageOfAvailableCollateral` is rounded down to 10.
```solidity
163:    uint percentageOfAvailableCollateral = (borrowInformation
            .availableAmount * 10000) / m_borrowInformation.startAmount;

        // if available amount is less than 0.1% of the start amount, the order is no longer active and will count as completed.
        if (percentageOfAvailableCollateral <= 10) {
            isActive = false;
```

### Root Cause

In `acceptBorrowOffer`, rounded down `percentageOfAvailableCollateral` is used to check if available amount is less than 0.1% of the start amount.

### Internal pre-conditions

`m_borrowInformation.startAmount * 10 < borrowInformation.availableAmount * 10000 <  m_borrowInformation.startAmount * 11`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The borrowing order is incorrectly marked as completed when `m_borrowInformation.startAmount * 10 < borrowInformation.availableAmount * 10000 <  m_borrowInformation.startAmount * 11`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the following code instead of the rounded down `percentageOfAvailableCollateral` to check if available amount is less than 0.1% of the start amount.
```solidity
    if (borrowInformation.availableAmount * 10000 <= m_borrowInformation.startAmount * 10) {
        isActive = false;
        ...
    }
```
