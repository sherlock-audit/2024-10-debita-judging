### Attack Path

If Bob extends a loan, he will need to pay 10% duration of the interest of all the extended offers within the loan. Assume that during the extension, Bob pay $X$ principle tokens as interest. The collected $X$ principle tokens interest are added to `loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestToClaim` state variable and store within the Loan contract.

Assume that Bob defaulted on the loan.

In this case, Alice, who is the owner of the Loan will execute the `claimCollateralAsLender` function to claim all the collateral stored within the loan. After the `claimCollateralAsLender` transaction is executed, Alice's lender NFT will immediately be burned, as per Line 349 below.

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Loan.sol
340:     function claimCollateralAsLender(uint index) external nonReentrant {
341:         LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;
342:         infoOfOffers memory offer = m_loan._acceptedOffers[index];
343:         IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);
344:         require(
345:             ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) == msg.sender,
346:             "Not lender"
347:         );
348:         // burn ownership
349:         ownershipContract.burn(offer.lenderID);
```

Next, Alice wants to claim the interest. Thus, she calls the `claimDebt` function, thinking that she can claim the interest. The `claimDebt` function will internally call the `claimInterest` function to claim $X$ principle tokens collected earlier as interest fees. 

However, since Alice's lender NFT is already burned, the check at Line 275 below will always revert. 

Thus, Alice cannot claim the interest anymore, and the interest is stuck within the Loan contract forever.

```solidity
File: DebitaV3Loan.sol
271:     function claimDebt(uint index) external nonReentrant {
272:         IOwnerships ownershipContract = IOwnerships(s_OwnershipContract);
273:         infoOfOffers memory offer = loanData._acceptedOffers[index];
274: 
275:         require(
276:             ownershipContract.ownerOf(offer.lenderID) == msg.sender,
277:             "Not lender"
278:         );
279:         // check if the offer has been paid, if not just call claimInterest function
280:         if (offer.paid) {
281:             _claimDebt(index);
282:         } else {
283:             // if not already full paid, claim interest
284:             claimInterest(index);
285:         }
286:     }
```

### Impact

High. Loss of assets. Interest cannot be collected and stuck in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When a lender executes the `claimCollateralAsLender` function to claim the collateral, return all interest collected in the Loan contract to the lenders before burning the lender NFT.
