# Attacker can Frontrun the `buyNFT` function to pay less money for `veTokens` that are Auctioned

### Summary

The `buyNFT` function can be frontrun by attackers when `veNFTs` are being auctioned off. Since these tokens are the governance tokens of the protocol, attackers might be more motivated to gain access to the tokens. 

A HIGH severity is considered for this vulnerability because these are the Governance Tokens of the protocol that are being auctioned off. 

### Root Cause

In a Dutch Auction, the price decreases steadily until somebody pays the price they feel is worth the item in the auction. 

In this protocol, veNFTs can be auctioned off to prospective buyers, either by their own accord or to liquidate a failed loan's collateral. The problem with the Auction in this protocol is that attackers can always frontrun the [`buyNFT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L109) function. 

An attacker will see that the veNFT is valuable, but they don't want to pay the full price for the veNFT. They will wait till an honest user calls the function to buy the veNFT, after which they will front-run the transaction and buy the veNFT for the lowest price possible in that auction (as compared to the original time/price the attacker wanted to buy the veNFT). The attacker would do this to pay less money, and sell the NFT at a later date for more profit.

### Impact

Every single auction in the protocol can be frontrun which can cause a lot of economic damages to the protocol, as well as reputation damage if the buy function of the auction never works. 

Additionally, it is to be noted that the veNFTs which are sold in the auction are the governance tokens of the protocol. Attackers will definitely be interested to buy up all available veNFTs if they aim to get more voting power.
