# Possible to Buy Nft for Free

### Summary

Attacker can precalculate `decreasedAmount = m_currentAuction.tickPerBlock * timePassed;` and purchase an nft for free if `m_currentAuction.initAmount == decreasedAmount`

### Root Cause

In `Auction::buyNft`, current price calculated `decreasedAmount` can be equal to `m_currentAuction.initAmount`  and this condition is not properly handled.

### Mitigation

 ```solidity
uint currentPrice = (decreasedAmount >=
            (m_currentAuction.initAmount - floorPrice))
            ? floorPrice
            : m_currentAuction.initAmount - decreasedAmount;
```
