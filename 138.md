# Insufficient checks to confirm the correct status of the sequencerUptimeFeed

## Summary
The `DebitaChainlink.sol` contract has `sequencerUptimeFeed` function in place to assert if the sequencer on `Arbitrum` is running, but this function has checks that are not implemented correctly. Since the protocol implements some checks for the `sequencerUptimeFeed` status, it should implement all of the checks.

## Vulnerability Details
The [[chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds)](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) say that `sequencerUptimeFeed` can return a 0 value for `startedAt` if it is called during an "invalid round".

> * startedAt: This timestamp indicates when the sequencer changed status. This timestamp returns `0` if a round is invalid. When the sequencer comes back up after an outage, wait for the `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME` to pass before accepting answers from the data feed. Subtract `startedAt` from `block.timestamp` and revert the request if the result is less than the `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME`.

Please note that an "invalid round" is described to mean there was a problem updating the sequencer's status, possibly due to network issues or problems with data from oracles, and is shown by a `startedAt` time of 0 and `answer` is 0. Further explanation can be seen as given by an official chainlink engineer as seen here in the chainlink public discord:

> Hello, @EricTee An "invalid round" means there was a problem updating the sequencer's status, possibly due to network issues or problems with data from oracles, and is shown by a `startedAt` time of 0. Normally, when a round starts, `startedAt` is recorded, and the initial status (`answer`) is set to `0`. Later, both the answer and the time it was updated (`updatedAt`) are set at the same time after getting enough data from oracles, making sure that answer only changes from `0` when there's a confirmed update different from the start time. This process helps avoid mistakes in judging if the sequencer is available, which could cause security issues. Making sure `startedAt` isn't `0` is crucial for keeping the system secure and properly informed about the sequencer's status.

Quoting Chainlink's developer final statement:
"Making sure `startedAt` isn't `0` is crucial for keeping the system secure and properly informed about the sequencer's status."

This also makes the implemented check below in the `DebitaChainlink::sequencerUptimeFeed` to be useless if its called in an invalid round:
```javascript
 uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
        if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
            revert GracePeriodNotOver();
        }
```
as `startedAt` will be `0`, the arithmetic operation `block.timestamp - startedAt` will result in a value greater than `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME` (which is hardcoded to be 3600) i.e block.timestamp = 1719739032, so 1719739032 - 0 = 1719739032 which is bigger than 3600. The code won't revert.

Imagine a case where a round starts, at the beginning `startedAt` is recorded to be 0, and `answer`, the initial status is set to be `0`. Note that docs say that if `answer = 0`, sequencer is up, if equals to `1`, sequencer is down. But in this case here, `answer` and `startedAt` can be `0` initially, till after all data is gotten from oracles and update is confirmed then the values are reset to the correct values that show the correct status of the sequencer.

From these explanations and information, it can be seen that `startedAt` value is a second value that should be used in the check for if a sequencer is down/up or correctly updated. The checks in `debitachainlink::sequencerUptimeFeed` will allow for sucessfull calls in an invalid round because reverts dont happen if `answer == 0` and `startedAt == 0` thus defeating the purpose of having a `sequencerFeed` check to assert the status of the `sequencerFeed` on L2 i.e if it is up/down/active or if its status is actually confirmed to be either.

There was also recently a [[pull request](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/documentation/pull/1995)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/documentation/pull/1995) to update the [[chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds)](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) sample code with this information, because this check should clearly be displayed there as well.

## Impact
Inadequate checks to confirm the correct status of the `sequencerUptimeFeed` in `debitachainlink::sequencerUptimeFeed` contract will cause `getThePrice()` to not revert even when the sequencer uptime feed is not updated or is called in an invalid round.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaChainlink.sol#L62
```javascript
function getThePrice(address tokenAddress) public view returns (int) {
        // falta hacer un chequeo para las l2
        address _priceFeed = priceFeeds[tokenAddress];
        require(!isPaused, "Contract is paused");
        require(_priceFeed != address(0), "Price feed not set");
        AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);

        // if sequencer is set, check if it's up
        // if it's down, revert
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) {
            checkSequencer();
        }
        (, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        return price;
    }
```
```javascript
function checkSequencer() public view returns (bool) {
        (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, , ) = sequencerUptimeFeed
            .latestRoundData();

        // Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
        // Answer == 1: Sequencer is down
        bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
        if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert SequencerDown();
        }
        console.logUint(startedAt);
        // Make sure the grace period has passed after the
        // sequencer is back up.
        uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
        if (timeSinceUp <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME) {
            revert GracePeriodNotOver();
        }

        return true;
    }
```

        uint256 timeSinceUp = block.timestamp - startedAt;
