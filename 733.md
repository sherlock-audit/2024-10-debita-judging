# buyOrderFactory Owner Cannot be Changed

### Summary

In the changeOwner function, the variable input is `owner` and the function is trying to change the value of another variable named `owner`. Because the function writes owner = owner, it simply sets the internal variable to itself and does not change the actual owner variable.
