# Lenders may lose some interest when borrowers extend their loan.

### Summary

When borrowers extend their loan, some interest will be saved into `interestToClaim`.  After the borrowers pay the debt, `interestToClaim` is set to the left interest. The previous interest may be lost.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Loan:extendLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L656), borrowers extend the loan, paid the previous duration's interest and record these accured interest in variable `interestToClaim` if the lend order's mode is not perpetual.
The problem is that in [payDebt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L238), when the borrowers want to repay the debt, we will calculate the left interest and set this left interest into variable `interestToClaim`.  This will cause that previous paid interest will be lost if the lend owner does not claimDebt before the borrowers pays the debt.
```solidity
    function extendLoan() public {
          loanData._acceptedOffers[i].interestToClaim +=
                        interestOfUsedTime -
                        interestToPayToDebita;
    }
```
```solidity
    function payDebt(uint[] memory indexes) public nonReentrant {
        loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim =
                    interest -
                    feeOnInterest;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

The lend owner does not claim debt before the borrowers pay the debt.
It's one normal scenario that the lend owners will expect to claim debt after the borrowers pay the debt.

### Attack Path

1. Borrower Alice extends this Loan X. Lend owner Bob have some borrow interest in `interestToClaim`.
2. Borrower Alice pay her debt. Bob's `interestToClaim` is updated to the left borrowing interest.
3. Bob claims his debt, the previous borrow interest will be lost.

### Impact

Lend owners may lose one part of borrow interest.

### Mitigation

```diff
-                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim =
+                loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim = loanData._acceptedOffers[index].interestToClaim
                     interest -
                     feeOnInterest;
             }
```
