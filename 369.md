# Malicious seller of receipt token is able to control the corresponding veNFT after a sell

### Summary

Malicious seller of receipt token is able to control the corresponding veNFT after a sell. This is possible due to the fact that the seller is still the  manager of the `veNFT` contract. The flow of the opperations is as it follows:
1. User creates vault and in this process he is the made the manager of the vault, and he is minted a receipt NFT.
2. After this happens, he can pick a [`buyOrder`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L32) and sell his receipt.
3. Even though he sold the receipt, he remains the manager of the veNFT, meaning that he can still vote, poke and reset the NFT
4. He then votes with small amount for a random pool
5. Then even if the new owner of the receipt change the NFT manager, he will be obligated to wait the whole 7 day period before being able to do anything with the veNFT (Assuming that this happens in the beginning of an epoch for the `Voter` contract)

The absolute same thing happens when a user is a borrower of a loan. If the `Loan` gets auctioned and someone call the [`Auction::buyNFT`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L109-L161) function, the malicious user can control the veNFT before the new owner call the [`veNFTVault::changeManager`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/Non-Fungible-Receipts/veNFTS/Aerodrome/veNFTAerodrome.sol#L110-L123) function 

This allows a malicious user to operate the veNFT on behalf of the new owners and block the NFT for the duration of 1 Voter epoch (7 days).

 
### Root Cause

Malicious user is the manager of the `veNFT` contract even after selling the token via `buyOrder`

### Internal pre-conditions

Malicious actor creating a veNFT vault, and then selling the receipt NFT via `buyOrder`

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Described in the `Summary` section

### Impact

veNFT vault being bricked for one week, respectively the buyers funds as well. Malicious user has the rights to operate the veNFT on behalf of the new actual owners
 
### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the `manager` role from both `veNFT` and `veNFTAerodrome` contracts and rely on the owner of the minted receipt NFT to call every function he wants
