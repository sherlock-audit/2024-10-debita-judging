# Precision lost in `DebitaIncentives.claimIncentives()` will missing rewards for users with smaller lending/borrow activities

### Summary

`DebitaIncentives.claimIncentives()` still use `10000` for precision calculation against variable with e18 decimals.
This cause some users with 1 USDC lending but total lending for that epoch is > 100000 USDC will not receive rewards.

### Root Cause

The `porcentageBorrow` and `porcentageLent` variable here use low precision decimals:
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L160-L162>
<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L175>

For example when calculate how much of the rewards the user will receive, the `porcentageBorrow` will be calculated as:

- `porcentageBorrow = (borrowAmount * 10000) / totalBorrowAmount`
- `borrowAmount`: how much the user has borrowed in this epoch
- `totalBorrowAmount`: the total amount borrowed from all users in this epoch
- Aggregator call `updateFunds()` [everytime a match offer is made.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L631-L636)
- `updateFunds()` cache user borrow amount to `borrowAmountPerEpoch` variable which equal to `borrowAmount`
- `updateFunds()` add new used token amount to `totalUsedTokenPerEpoch` variable which equal to `totalBorrowAmount`

Because `borrowAmount` and `totalBorrowAmount` are calculated in token precision which is e18 decimals.
The `porcentageBorrow` use low precision e5 will cause the rewards calculation to be inaccurate.

### internal pre-conditions

- user create a borrow order for 10 USDC.
- Order match and Aggregator cache user borrow amount to `borrowAmountPerEpoch` with 10 USDC.
- Total lending/borrow USDC for that epoch is 1,000,000 USDC
- Admin rewards 1000 AERO for borrower and lender in that epoch

### External pre-conditions

- User call `claimIncentives()` function

### Attack Path

- User suppose to receive `10 USDC / 1_000_000 USDC * 1000 AERO` = 0.01 AERO
- But user receive 0 AERO due to precision lost when divided by total USDC used in that epoch

### Impact

The users suffer loss of rewards token due to precision loss.
