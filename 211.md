# The fee calculation in extendLoan function has a error

### Summary

When a borrower extends the loan duration, they are required to pay additional fees for the extended time. However, due to a calculation error, this fee may be incorrect, potentially causing the user to pay more than necessary.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L602
```solidity
                // if user already paid the max fee, then we dont have to charge them again
                if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
                    // calculate difference from fee paid for the initialDuration vs the extra fee they should pay because of the extras days of extending the loan.  MAXFEE shouldnt be higher than extra fee + PorcentageOfFeePaid
                    uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /
                        86400);
                    if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
                        feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
                    } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) {
                        feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
                    }

                    misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
                }
```

The calculation for feeOfMaxDeadline should be:

extendedLoanDuration * feePerDay,

where extendedLoanDuration represents the extended borrowing time. However, the function mistakenly uses the timestamp directly for calculations, leading to an incorrect fee computation.
