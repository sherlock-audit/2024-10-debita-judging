# Avoiding Fees by Exploiting Auction Cancellation

### Summary

The Attacker can create to sell his own nft and cancel the auction anytime.
So when the buyer is going to buy nft, the attacker cancels the auction and contact directly without any fees.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/auctions/Auction.sol#L168
Because there is no limitation in cancel auction function.

### Root Cause

The attacker creates auction and when the buyer is going to nft, cancel auction by front-running.
And the attacker contacts directly with the buyer.
So the attacker can buy his any nft without any fee.

### Internal pre-conditions

The attacker creates auction and when the buyer is going to nft, cancel auction by front-running.
And the attacker contacts directly with the buyer.
So the attacker can buy his any nft without any fee.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The attacker creates auction and when the buyer is going to nft, cancel auction by front-running.
And the attacker contacts directly with the buyer.
So the attacker can buy his any nft without any fee.

### Impact

The Attacker can sell his nft without fee.
The system enables contact between the attacker and the buyer without incurring fees, resulting in the system losing a fee of 20% of the current price.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check in the cancelAuction function to prevent cancellation if the auction is already being processed by a buyer.
```solidity
require(!s_CurrentAuction.isLocked, "Cannot cancel during an active purchase");
    s_CurrentAuction.isActive = false; // Deactivate the auction
    // Proceed with cancellation logic
```
