# Precision loss leads to locked incentives in `DebitaIncentives::claimIncentives()`

### Summary

When a lender or borrwer calls `DebitaIncentives::claimIncentives()` to claim a share of the incentives for a specific token pair they interacted with during an epoch, their share is calculated as a [percentage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/1465ba6884c4cc44f7fc28e51f792db346ab1e33/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L161). This percentage is determined based on the amount they lent or borrowed through the protocol during that epoch, relative to the total amount lent and borrowed by all users in the same period.

The percentage is rounded to two decimal places, which means up to `0.0099%` of the incentives may remain unclaimed for each lender or borrower.  Consider the following simple scenario:

1. Six lenders each lent `5e18` over a 14-day period for a specific token pair
2. That token pair is incentivized with `1000e18`
3. The total amount lent equals `6 * 5e18 = 30e18`

After each lender calls `DebitaIncentives::claimIncentives()`, there will still be `4e17` locked in the contract permanently. This means the incentivizer loses `0.04%` of their incentives and every lender lost `4e17 / 6`.

### Root Cause

In `DebitaIncentives.sol`, there is no mechanism for incentivizers to withdraw unclaimed incentives that cannot be claimed due to precision loss.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Incentivizers need to call `DebitaIncentives::incentivizePair()` to incentivize specific token pairs.
2. Users need to interact with one of these incentivized pairs by borrowing or lending them.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A user that interacted with an incentivized token pair calls `DebitaIncentives::claimIncentives()`. He will receive less funds due to rounding. The funds will be stuck in the contract.

### Impact

In this example, the incentivizer suffers an approximate loss of `0.04%`. This loss could increase as the number of distinct lenders and borrowers interacting with the protocol grows, aligning with the protocol's objective of fostering increased activity.
Users experience a partial loss of their incentive share each time they interact with an incentivized pair within a 14-day period.

It is important to note that incentivizers can incentivize an unlimited number of token pairs for an unlimited number of `epochs`.
Additionally, lenders can participate across multiple `epochs`.

While the amount of locked funds in this simple scenario is relatively small, similar scenarios could occur repeatedly over an unlimited number of `epochs`. Over time, this accumulation could result in hundreds of tokens being permanently locked in the contract.

### PoC

The following should be added in `MultipleLoansDuringIncentives.t.sol`:

```solidity
address fourthLender = address(0x04);
address fifthLender = address(0x05);
address sixthLender = address(0x06);
```

Add the following test to `MultipleLoansDuringIncentives.t.sol`:

```solidity
function testUnclaimableIncentives() public {
    incentivize(AERO, AERO, USDC, true, 1000e18, 2);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 15 days);
    createLoan(borrower, firstLender, AERO, AERO);
    createLoan(borrower, secondLender, AERO, AERO);
    createLoan(borrower, thirdLender, AERO, AERO);
    createLoan(borrower, fourthLender, AERO, AERO);
    createLoan(borrower, fifthLender, AERO, AERO);
    createLoan(borrower, sixthLender, AERO, AERO);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);
        
    // principles, tokenIncentives, epoch with dynamic Data
    address[] memory principles = allDynamicData.getDynamicAddressArray(1);
    address[] memory tokenUsedIncentive = allDynamicData
        .getDynamicAddressArray(1);
    address[][] memory tokenIncentives = new address[][](
        tokenUsedIncentive.length
    );
    principles[0] = AERO;
    tokenUsedIncentive[0] = USDC;
    tokenIncentives[0] = tokenUsedIncentive;

    vm.startPrank(firstLender);
    uint balanceBefore_First = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(firstLender);
    incentivesContract.claimIncentives(principles, tokenIncentives, 2);
    uint balanceAfter_First = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(firstLender);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(secondLender);
    uint balanceBefore_Second = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(secondLender);
    incentivesContract.claimIncentives(principles, tokenIncentives, 2);
    uint balanceAfter_Second = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(secondLender);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(thirdLender);
    uint balanceBefore_Third = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(thirdLender);
    incentivesContract.claimIncentives(principles, tokenIncentives, 2);
    uint balanceAfter_Third = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(thirdLender);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(fourthLender);
    uint balanceBefore_Fourth = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(fourthLender);
    incentivesContract.claimIncentives(principles, tokenIncentives, 2);
    uint balanceAfter_Fourth = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(fourthLender);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(fifthLender);
    uint balanceBefore_Fifth = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(fifthLender);
    incentivesContract.claimIncentives(principles, tokenIncentives, 2);
    uint balanceAfter_Fifth = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(fifthLender);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(sixthLender);
    uint balanceBefore_Sixth = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(sixthLender);
    incentivesContract.claimIncentives(principles, tokenIncentives, 2);
    uint balanceAfter_Sixth = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(sixthLender);
    vm.stopPrank();

    uint claimedFirst = balanceAfter_First - balanceBefore_First;
    uint claimedSecond = balanceAfter_Second - balanceBefore_Second;
    uint claimedThird = balanceAfter_Third - balanceBefore_Third;
    uint claimedFourth = balanceAfter_Fourth - balanceBefore_Fourth;
    uint claimedFifth = balanceAfter_Fifth - balanceBefore_Fifth;
    uint claimedSixth = balanceAfter_Sixth - balanceBefore_Sixth;

    assertEq(claimedFirst, claimedSecond);
    assertEq(claimedSecond, claimedThird);
    assertEq(claimedThird, claimedFourth);
    assertEq(claimedFourth, claimedFifth);
    assertEq(claimedFifth, claimedSixth);

    // formula percentage: porcentageLent = (lentAmount * 10000) / totalLentAmount;
    // (5e18 * 10000) / 30e18 = 1666.66667 (16.6666667%)
    // rounded to 1666 (16%), 0.66667 (0.0066667%) will be lost
    uint amount = (1000e18 * 1666) / 10000;

    assertEq(amount, 1666e17);
    assertEq(claimedFirst, amount);
        
    uint claimedAmount = claimedFirst + claimedSecond + claimedThird + claimedFourth + claimedFifth + claimedSixth;

    // 6 different lenders with lend orders of 5e18 will not get the whole 1000e18 of incentives
    assertNotEq(1000e18, claimedAmount);

    // percentage should be approximately 1666.66667 (16.6666667%)
    // rounded to 1666 (16%), 0.66667 (0.0066667%) will be lost per lend order

    uint lockedAmount = 1000e18 - claimedAmount;

    // 0.04% of 1000e18 (4e17) will be locked forever
    assertEq(lockedAmount, 4e17);
}
```

### Mitigation

Consider adding a mechanism that allows incentivizers to withdraw their unclaimed incentives from all their past incentivized epochs after a specified period following the end of the last incentivized epoch (e.g., two epochs later).
