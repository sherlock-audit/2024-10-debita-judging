# Anyone can replace other borrowers or lender to claim the incentives

### Summary

There is no verification of the incentives recipient, which allows anyone to impersonate other borrowers and claim their incentives.


### Root Cause

Vulnerable code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L203
Using msg.sender to send rewards to the caller without performing a check allows an attacker to impersonate a borrower and claim their  incentives . Additionally, we can see that the function claimIncentivesï¼š
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaIncentives.sol#L142-L147
As long as the attacker forwards another person's parameter information, they can impersonate them and claim the  incentives

### Internal pre-conditions

- The claimIncentives function is public


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Alice has successfully borrowed tokens, and when she calls the `claimIncentives` function to claim the   incentives, the transaction is packaged into the transaction pool.
- Bob is always ready to monitor this transaction pool. Upon discovering Alice's transaction, he can retrieve the transaction details `(address[] memory principles, address[][] memory tokensIncentives, uint epoch)`, and then submit a higher gas fee for the same transaction, which will be processed first.
- At this point, Bob impersonates Alice to claim her incentives. When Alice's transaction is processed, she will be marked as having already claimed the  incentives

### Impact

- Borrowers are unable to claim the rewards they are entitled to.
- A front-running transaction attack occurs.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Perform a check on the msg.sender calling the claimIncentives function.
```solidity
function claimIncentives(
    address[] memory principles,
    address[][] memory tokensIncentives,
    uint epoch,
) public {
    // Ensure the caller is the borrower
    require(msg.sender == borrower, "Only the borrower can claim incentives");

    // ... existing logic
}

```
- Ensure that this epoch ,the principal, and the borrower are correctly matched.
