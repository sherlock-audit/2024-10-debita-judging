# The protocol does not account for the exponent of the `pyth` oracle when retrieving the token's price

### Summary

The `pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan` function returns the price in the format of `price * 10^expo` described in [here](https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm/getPriceNoOlderThan#:~:text=Sample%20price%20object%3A). However, the protocol does not take this into consideration when using the price. As a result, the order matching mechanism is compromised.

### Root Cause

The `DebitaPyth.getThePrice` function gets the token's price from `pyth` oracle from [L40](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/tree/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/oracles/DebitaPyth.sol#L40).

```solidity
        PythStructs.Price memory priceData = pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan(
            _priceFeed,
            600
        );
        require(isFeedAvailable[_priceFeed], "Price feed not available");
        require(priceData.price > 0, "Invalid price");
L40:    return priceData.price;
```

And the returned price is used to match the lend and borrow orders in the `DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3()` function from [L350](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/tree/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L40) and L451.

```solidity
L350:       uint ValuePrincipleFullLTVPerCollateral = (priceCollateral_BorrowOrder *
                10 ** 8) / pricePrinciple;
L451:       uint fullRatioPerLending = (priceCollateral_LendOrder *
                    10 ** 8) / pricePrinciple;
```

However, directly using the returned price is incorrect because it does not account for the exponent of the `pyth` price feed.
The `PythStructs.Price` struct has the following structure:

```solidity
File: Debita-V3-Contracts\node_modules\@pythnetwork\pyth-sdk-solidity\PythStructs.sol
    struct Price {
        // Price
        int64 price;
        // Confidence interval around the price
        uint64 conf;
        // Price exponent
        int32 expo;
        // Unix timestamp describing when the price was published
        uint publishTime;
    }
```

Let's assume `pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan()` function returns the following value.
This is described in [here](https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm/getPriceNoOlderThan#:~:text=Sample%20price%20object%3A).

```solidity
{
    price: 123456789n,
    conf: 180726074n,
    expo: -8,
    publishTime: 1721765108n
}
```

The `price` above is in the format of `price * 10^expo`. So, the price in above mentioned sample represents the number 123456789 * 10^(-8) = 1.23456789 in this case. This means the price of token is `1.23456789`, not `123456789`.
However, the `DebitaV3Aggregator.matchOffersV3()` function uses `123456789` and do not use 10^(-8).
As a result, `ratiosForBorrower` and `userUsedCollateral` are calculated incorrectly and this breaks the matching of lend and borrow orders.

### Internal pre-conditions

A user creates the order with `pyth` oracle.

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenarion:
- There are matching available lending and borrowing order.
    - collateral token: cbBTC
    - principle token: AXP
    - all of principle and collateral oracle of borrow order: pyth
- The `pyth` oracle returns the price of `cbBTC` as 90,000e8(90,000USD) and the price of `AXP` as `30,000,000`(300 USD)
    - The exponent of `cbBTC` is -8: https://www.pyth.network/price-feeds/crypto-cbbtc-usd#:~:text=Price-,Exponent,-%2D8
    - The exponent of `AXP` is -5: https://www.pyth.network/price-feeds/equity-us-axp-usd#:~:text=Price-,Exponent,-%2D5
    - `priceCollateral_BorrowOrder` is calculated as `90,000e8`, not `90,000` and `pricePrinciple` is calculated as `30,000,000`, not `300`.

As a result, `ratiosForBorrower` is calculated greater than actual value and this causes valid matching revert from L536.

```solidity
File: Debita-V3-Contracts\contracts\DebitaV3Aggregator.sol
        require(
L536:       weightedAverageRatio[i] >=
                ((ratiosForBorrower[i] * 9800) / 10000) &&
                weightedAverageRatio[i] <=
                (ratiosForBorrower[i] * 10200) / 10000,
            "Invalid ratio"
        );
```

For simplicity, this scenario uses the same oracle for collateral and principle.
If one uses `pyth` oracle and other uses `chainlink` oracle, there still exists this vulnerability.

Also, this causes incorrect calculation of `userUsedCollateral`.

### Impact

The price that does not account for the exponent breaks the order matching mechanism.
This causes user's loss of funds.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

It is recommended to modify the code to take into account the exponent of the `pyth` price feed when using the token's price.
