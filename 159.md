# wantedToken NFT will be locked in buyOrder

### Summary

In buyOrder, we lack interface to allow the buyOrder's owner to transfer bought NFT to his own address. The wanted NFT will be locked in buyOrder.

### Root Cause

In [buyOrder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrder.sol#L92), the buyOrder's owner pay some ERC20 buy tokens to place one buy order. Users can sell the wanted NFT token to get these buy tokens.
The problem is that when users sell wanted Token, the wanted NFT token will be transferred into buyOrder contract. We lack one interface to allow the buy order's owner to withdraw this wanted NFT. These wanted NFTs will be locked in buyOrder contract forever.
```solidity
    function sellNFT(uint receiptID) public {
        ...
        IERC721(buyInformation.wantedToken).transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            receiptID
        );
    }
```
