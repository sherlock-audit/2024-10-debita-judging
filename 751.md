# Variable Shadowing Prevents Owner Change in `changeOwner` Function

Impact : High
Likelihood : Low
Severity : Medium


#### **Summary**

Variable shadowing of the `owner` variable in the `changeOwner` function prevents the update of the contract's owner, causing an inability to transfer ownership. This affects the **contract owner**, as they cannot delegate control to another address, potentially hindering critical administrative actions.

---

#### **Root Cause**

In the `DebitaV3Aggregator::changeOwner` function  (also present in `auctionFactory.sol` and `buyOrderFactory.sol`), the parameter `owner` shadows the state variable `owner`. This leads to the assignment `owner = owner;` having no effect on the state variable:

#### **Issue Path**

1. The **contract owner** attempts to transfer ownership by calling `changeOwner(newOwnerAddress)`.
2. The function checks `require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");` which always passes since `msg.sender` is the current owner.
3. The function attempts to update the owner with `owner = owner;`, but due to variable shadowing, this line assigns the parameter `owner` to itself, leaving the state variable unchanged.
4. Ownership remains with the original owner, and the new owner does not receive control.

---

#### **Impact**

In the event that the owner's private key is compromised, there is no way to remove or replace the current owner. An attacker with control over the compromised key retains full ownership privileges indefinitely.

The owner has access to critical administrative functions within the contract, including:

  - Pausing or unpausing the aggregator (`isPaused`), affecting the creation of new loans.
  - Setting and adjusting various fees (`feePerDay`, `maxFEE`, `minFEE`, `feeCONNECTOR`).
  - Enabling or disabling oracles (`oracleEnabled`), which could affect price feeds and loan calculations.
  - Whitelisting or blacklisting collateral assets (`isCollateralAValidReceipt`).


---


#### **Mitigation**

Rename the parameter in the `changeOwner` function to avoid shadowing the state variable `owner`. 

```solidity
function changeOwner(address _newOwner) public {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner");
    require(deployedTime + 6 hours > block.timestamp, "6 hours passed");
    owner = _newOwner; // Correctly updates the state variable
}
```
