# Users can pass in malicious oracle addresses during createLendOrder() and createBorrowOrder()

### Summary

In debita V3, the protocol supports functionality for users to create lend offers and borrow offers and specify oracle addresses to retrieve the price of collateral/principle tokens instead of just defaulting to a fixed ratio (number of collateral tokens worth per principle token, vice-versa).

The protocol provides various oracle contracts such as DebitaChainLink, DebitaPyth and MixOracle. It is intended for users to provide the address of these oracle contracts during `createLendOffer()` and `createBorrowOffer()`.

However, there is a lack of validation checks on the addresses provided as oracles. This means that users can use any arbitrary contract as the oracle and still create their lend/ borrow offer, proceed to have their orders matched, etc.

### Root Cause

Due to a lack of validation on the addresses provided, users can pass in malicious oracles to inflate the value of their collateral/ principle tokens.

### Attack Path

1. user creates a borrow order and provides a malicious oracle address as` address _oracleID_Collateral`

2. In matchOffersV3(), this malicious oracle is used to inflate the value of collateral provided by the borrower
