# Missing Stale Price Check in DebitaChainlink Contract Could Lead to Incorrect Price Calculations

### Summary

The lack of a stale price check in the `DebitaChainlink` contract's `getThePrice` function will cause **potentially incorrect calculations** for **protocol users and downstream operations** as the contract relies solely on the `price > 0` check, ignoring the timestamp data from Chainlink's `latestRoundData()` response. This opens up the protocol to risks associated with stale prices, as highlighted in the [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds).  


### Root Cause


In the following code snippet:  
```solidity  
(, int price, , , ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();  
require(price > 0, "Invalid price");  
```  
the contract does not validate whether the price fetched is stale by checking the `updatedAt` timestamp returned by the `latestRoundData()` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The Chainlink oracle must return stale data due to an external issue (e.g., lack of updates or malfunction in the price feed).  
2. The protocol must invoke `getThePrice` without validating the freshness of the price data.  
3. Downstream functions or calculations using the stale price must assume it is valid, leading to incorrect outputs.  


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact


The protocol  suffer a potential loss due to calculations based on outdated price data.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a stale data validation step by comparing the `updatedAt` timestamp of the price feed against the current block timestamp. Ensure this check is integrated into the `getThePrice` function. For example:  

```solidity  
(uint80 roundId, int price, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();  
require(price > 0, "Invalid price");  
require(updatedAt + 1 hours > block.timestamp, "Stale price data");  
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Incomplete round");  
```
