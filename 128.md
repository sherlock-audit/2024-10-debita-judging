# Borrowers may fail to extend their loan in some cases.

### Summary

`extendedTime`'s calculation is incorrect. This calculation may be reverted in some cases. This will cause that borrowers cannot block their loan.

### Root Cause

In [DebitaV3Loan:extendLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L590), borrowers can extend their loan.

According to extendLoan()'s logic, if we pass the 10% of the initial duration and doesn't pass the next deadline, borrowers can extend their loan.
The problem is that there is one variable `extendedTime`. It should be the extended time compared with the initial duration. But this `extendedTime`'s calculation is incorrect. Although we don't use this `extendedTime` in any place, the incorrect calculation may cause underflow and reverted.
For example:
- startedAt: timestampA
- block.timestamp = timestampA + 100
- initialDuration = 120, initial deadline = timestampA + 120
- offer.maxDeadline = timestampA + 150
- When we try to calculate `extendedTime`, extendTime = (timestampA + 150) - (100) - (timestampA + 100) < 0. This calculation will be underflow and reverted. 

```solidity
    function extendLoan() public {
        require(
            ownershipContract.ownerOf(loanData.borrowerID) == msg.sender,
            "Not borrower"
        );
        require(
            nextDeadline() > block.timestamp,
            "Deadline passed to extend loan"
        );
        require(loanData.extended == false, "Already extended");
        // at least 10% of the loan duration has to be transcurred in order to extend the loan
        uint minimalDurationPayment = (m_loan.initialDuration * 1000) / 10000;
        require(
            (block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt) > minimalDurationPayment,
            "Not enough time"
        );
```
```solidity
    function extendLoan() public {
                   uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;
 @>                   uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - 
                    alreadyUsedTime -
                    block.timestamp;
    }
```

Borrowers may fail to extend their loan. This is not the expected behavior.

### Mitigation

If we don't plan to use `extendedTime`, we can just delete it. Or
```diff
-                uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline -
-                    alreadyUsedTime -
-                    block.timestamp;
+                uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline - (m_loan.startedAt + m_loan.initialDuration)
+                //    alreadyUsedTime -
+                //    block.timestamp;
```
