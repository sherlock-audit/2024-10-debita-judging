# Violation of ERC-721 Standard in Ownerships:tokenURI Implementation

### Summary

The VerbsToken contract does not comply with the ERC-721 standard, specifically regarding the tokenURI implementation. According to the ERC-721 specification, the tokenURI function must revert if a non-existent tokenId is passed. However, in the VerbsToken contract, this behavior is not enforced, resulting in a deviation from the EIP-721 standard.

### Root Cause

The tokenURI function does not revert when the tokenId is 0, which is not a valid tokenId.
In the _debita implementation, the initial valid tokenId is 1.

Relevant code:

[DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L285](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Aggregator.sol#L285)

[DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol#L81](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLoanOwnerships.sol#L81)

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

An invalid tokenId case is handled incorrectly, as the tokenURI function does not revert.

### Impact

The implementation does not adhere to the ERC-721 specification, potentially leading to incorrect or undefined behavior for invalid tokenId inputs.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
  require(tokenId > 0, "Invalid tokenId");
```
