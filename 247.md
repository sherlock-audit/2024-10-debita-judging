# Hardcoded Auction Duration Violates Protocol Specification and Reduces User Control

### Summary

DebitaV3Loan::createAuctionForCollateral function deals with auction creation. While Debita docs clearly state that "When initiating an auction, the sender must define the initial amount, floor amount, and auction duration." , the auction duration is defined by the protocol as an hardcoded value. This issue will greatly hinder user flexibility.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L470C7-L478C1

DebitaV3Loan::createAuctionForCollateral function hardcodes the auction duration.
```solidity
 function createAuctionForCollateral(
        uint indexOfLender
    ) external nonReentrant {
        LoanData memory m_loan = loanData;

        address lenderAddress = safeGetOwner(
            m_loan._acceptedOffers[indexOfLender].lenderID
        );
        address borrowerAddress = safeGetOwner(m_loan.borrowerID);

        bool hasLenderRightToInitAuction = lenderAddress == msg.sender &&
            m_loan._acceptedOffers[indexOfLender].paid == false;
        bool hasBorrowerRightToInitAuction = borrowerAddress == msg.sender &&
            m_loan._acceptedOffers.length > 1;

        // check if collateral is actually NFT
        require(m_loan.isCollateralNFT, "Collateral is not NFT");

        // check that total count paid is not equal to the total offers
        require(
            m_loan.totalCountPaid != m_loan._acceptedOffers.length,
            "Already paid everything"
        );
        // check if the deadline has passed
        require(nextDeadline() < block.timestamp, "Deadline not passed");
        // check if the auction has not been already initialized
        require(m_loan.auctionInitialized == false, "Already initialized");
        // check if the lender has the right to initialize the auction
        // check if the borrower has the right to initialize the auction
        require(
            hasLenderRightToInitAuction || hasBorrowerRightToInitAuction,
            "Not involved"
        );
        // collateral has to be NFT

        AuctionFactory auctionFactory = AuctionFactory(
            Aggregator(AggregatorContract).s_AuctionFactory()
        );
        loanData.auctionInitialized = true;
        IveNFTEqualizer.receiptInstance memory receiptInfo = IveNFTEqualizer(
            m_loan.collateral
        ).getDataByReceipt(m_loan.NftID);

        // calculate floor amount for liquidations
        uint floorAmount = auctionFactory.getLiquidationFloorPrice(
            receiptInfo.lockedAmount
        );

        // create auction and save the information
        IERC721(m_loan.collateral).approve(
            address(auctionFactory),
            m_loan.NftID
        );
//@audit duration is hardcoded
        address liveAuction = auctionFactory.createAuction(
            m_loan.NftID,
            m_loan.collateral,
            receiptInfo.underlying,
            receiptInfo.lockedAmount,
            floorAmount,
            864000
        );

        auctionData = AuctionData({
            auctionAddress: liveAuction,
            liquidationAddress: receiptInfo.underlying,
            soldAmount: 0,
            tokenPerCollateralUsed: 0,
            alreadySold: false
        });
        Aggregator(AggregatorContract).emitLoanUpdated(address(this));

        // emit event here
    }
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The affected parties (auction creators) lose critical control over their auction strategy as they:

Cannot optimize auction duration based on market conditions
Cannot create quick sales when market volatility requires it
Are forced into 10-day auctions even when shorter durations would be more profitable
Cannot implement different strategies for different assets or market conditions

This fixed duration could lead to:

Reduced selling prices if 10 days is too long for current market conditions
Missed opportunities when faster sales would be advantageous
Increased exposure to market volatility
Inability to implement emergency liquidations

### PoC

Debita docs here => https://debita-finance.gitbook.io/debita-v3/marketplace/auctions have the following line:

> When initiating an auction, the sender must define the initial amount, floor amount, and auction duration. 

Suggesting that the sender must define the above params, while the implementation takes the control of auction duration from the sender.

### Mitigation

Allow the user to decide the auction time.
