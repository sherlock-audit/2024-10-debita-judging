# Missing Upgradeability Mechanism for Factory Contracts.

### Summary

The Factory contracts are designed to create proxy-based lend orders, borrowOrders and buyOrders that rely on the `implementationContract` for logic execution. However, the following factory contracts lacks a mechanism to update the `implementationContract` address, which prevents the protocol from upgrading the implementation logic. 

Affected Code:
[DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaLendOfferFactory.sol#L93)
[buyOrderFactory.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/buyOrders/buyOrderFactory.sol#L52)
[DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaBorrowOffer-Factory.sol#L48)


### Root Cause

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Once deployed, the factory contract cannot point new proxies to updated implementations, forcing a redeployment of the entire factory for future upgrades.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a mechanism in the factory to allow updates to the implementationContract. This should include appropriate access control and safeguards to ensure the process is secure and transparent.

Example:
```solidity
function updateImplementationContract(address newImplementation) external {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can update");
    require(newImplementation != address(0), "Invalid address");
    implementationContract = newImplementation;
}

```
