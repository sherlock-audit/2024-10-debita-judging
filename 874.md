# TaxTokensReceipt.sol does not support fee-on-transfer tokens

### Summary

Contest README says : `Fee-on-transfer tokens will be used only in TaxTokensReceipt contract` but its logic prevents any usage of such tokens.

### Root Cause

TaxTokensReceipt.sol::deposit() checks that amount of token received is not less than amount taken from the sender, which will revert when using fee-on-transfer tokens (usage of such tokens is stated in the README).
```solidity
    function deposit(uint amount) public nonReentrant returns (uint) {
        uint balanceBefore = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            ERC20(tokenAddress),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint balanceAfter = ERC20(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint difference = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
>       require(difference >= amount, "TaxTokensReceipts: deposit failed");
        tokenID++;
        tokenAmountPerID[tokenID] = amount;
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenID);
        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
        return tokenID;
    }
```

### Attack Path

### Impact

deposit() function is unusable and because of that withdraw() function becomes useless as well.

### Mitigation

Implement support for fee-on-transfer tokens
